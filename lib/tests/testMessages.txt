[04/09/2019, 22:34:15] Spongebob: Hey Balham üëã it's Spongebob
[04/09/2019, 22:34:30] Spongebob: What are you up to Friday?
[04/09/2019, 22:44:18] Sandy Cheeks: Hey! Okay so this weekend is shit for me because my dad is coming over
[04/09/2019, 22:44:27] Sandy Cheeks: So it‚Äôs family stuff pretty much the whole time
[04/09/2019, 22:44:49] Sandy Cheeks: But Sunday arvo would maybe be okay?
[04/09/2019, 22:58:52] Spongebob: Don't worry he's more than welcome
[04/09/2019, 22:59:51] Spongebob: Haha, possibly could work! What are you thinking?
[04/09/2019, 23:00:22] Sandy Cheeks: Hahahahah now that‚Äôs a hell of a first hinge date
[04/09/2019, 23:00:34] Sandy Cheeks: Maybe like 3/4 ish?
[04/09/2019, 23:03:28] Spongebob: It would be...an experience
[04/09/2019, 23:03:52] Spongebob: Cool! Can I let you know? What you be down for?
[04/09/2019, 23:04:08] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah of course! No pressure at all
[04/09/2019, 23:04:42] Sandy Cheeks: well the weather is supposed to be great so like a drink outside somewhere? Maybe a dog friendly venue?
[04/09/2019, 23:05:02] Spongebob: ...do you have a dog?
[04/09/2019, 23:05:06] Spongebob: Have we discussed this?
[04/09/2019, 23:05:09] Spongebob: That sounds great
[04/09/2019, 23:05:26] Sandy Cheeks: No we haven‚Äôt but I assumed the one in your photos was yours ?!
[04/09/2019, 23:05:40] Sandy Cheeks: I might ask if I can borrow my friends dog
[04/09/2019, 23:09:22] Spongebob: I feel like we've both been disappointed here
[04/09/2019, 23:09:28] Spongebob: I mean yes? Absolutely?
[04/09/2019, 23:09:30] Spongebob: What kind of dog?
[04/09/2019, 23:09:33] Spongebob: Not that I'm picky
[04/09/2019, 23:12:15] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs a sausage dog!
[04/09/2019, 23:16:57] Spongebob: YES
[04/09/2019, 23:17:12] Sandy Cheeks: The transaction is in the works
[04/09/2019, 23:17:21] Spongebob: Okay I'm meant to be climbing on Sunday so I'll let you know closer to, but that sounds like fun
[04/09/2019, 23:17:41] Spongebob: I should be able to work around it for the sake of the sausage
[04/09/2019, 23:17:48] Spongebob: (And obviously the company)
[04/09/2019, 23:17:52] Sandy Cheeks: So.. is this like a no dog no date kind of thing?
[04/09/2019, 23:18:00] Sandy Cheeks: Okay good was gonna say
[04/09/2019, 23:18:14] Spongebob: Was it that obvious?
[04/09/2019, 23:18:31] Spongebob: But thst sounds like fun. Where would be best given the dog?
[04/09/2019, 23:18:45] Spongebob: I assume tube journeys are off the cards
[04/09/2019, 23:18:56] Sandy Cheeks: This is the most excitement I‚Äôve seen in the conversation so yes
[04/09/2019, 23:19:04] Sandy Cheeks: Look I haven‚Äôt thought that far ahead
[04/09/2019, 23:19:54] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm hustle the dog first then make a decision
[04/09/2019, 23:20:11] Spongebob: Sorry I've become overwhelmed
[04/09/2019, 23:20:28] Sandy Cheeks: You‚Äôve got your priorities straight I get it
[04/09/2019, 23:20:41] Spongebob: In a way
[04/09/2019, 23:21:00] Spongebob: You talk to your people, I'll talk to myself and we can make plans
[04/09/2019, 23:21:18] Sandy Cheeks: Okay sounds good üëçüëç
[04/09/2019, 23:24:20] Spongebob: Cool üôå gonna head off, speak soon x
[04/09/2019, 23:25:12] Sandy Cheeks: Have a nice night! X
[05/09/2019, 17:44:09] Sandy Cheeks: No promises but
‚Äé[05/09/2019, 17:44:18] Sandy Cheeks: ‚Äé<attached: 00000046-PHOTO-2019-09-05-17-44-18.jpg>
[05/09/2019, 18:56:50] Spongebob: Holeee shit
[05/09/2019, 18:57:09] Spongebob: He is a saint and I will protect him with my life
[05/09/2019, 20:19:09] Sandy Cheeks: He had me at ‚Äúhe has a few jackets‚Äù
[05/09/2019, 20:51:44] Spongebob: I don't want to give you the impression I'm not excited to meet you
[05/09/2019, 20:52:17] Spongebob: But I will spend some degree of the day with him, cuddling
[06/09/2019, 00:29:24] Sandy Cheeks: Nah it‚Äôs all good
[06/09/2019, 00:29:40] Sandy Cheeks: To be honest I thought the pup in your photo was yours too
[06/09/2019, 00:29:53] Sandy Cheeks: Are you familiar with the term ‚Äúdog fishing‚Äù
[06/09/2019, 09:46:52] Spongebob: I do live on a throne of lies
[06/09/2019, 09:47:24] Spongebob: I had a dog but he passed away in 2017, although he did bite people so may not have been the best shout
[06/09/2019, 09:47:41] Spongebob: Sit on a throne* ffs get the reference right Spongebob
[06/09/2019, 09:47:54] Spongebob: I'm not, and am worried about the explanation
[06/09/2019, 10:56:55] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs like cat fishing, but instead of the guy having photos of someone he is not on his profile to pull, he has photos of a dog that‚Äôs not his to achieve the same effect
[06/09/2019, 10:57:31] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôve coined it dog fishing
[06/09/2019, 10:58:16] Spongebob: ...well I feel exposed.
‚Äé[06/09/2019, 10:58:18] Spongebob: ‚Äé<attached: 00000062-PHOTO-2019-09-06-10-58-18.jpg>
[06/09/2019, 10:59:03] Spongebob: Dating apps have a weird obsession with dogs in general, I've found
[06/09/2019, 10:59:08] Sandy Cheeks: Hahahahah well it worked so kudos to you!
[06/09/2019, 10:59:32] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah right?! Like having a dog/liking dogs isn‚Äôt a personality trait
‚Äé[06/09/2019, 10:59:35] Spongebob: ‚Äé<attached: 00000066-PHOTO-2019-09-06-10-59-35.jpg>
[06/09/2019, 10:59:48] Spongebob: tbf this is the only one I have with my actual dog
[06/09/2019, 10:59:50] Sandy Cheeks: Is that your one who died?
[06/09/2019, 10:59:59] Sandy Cheeks: She‚Äôs beautiful ‚ù§
[06/09/2019, 11:00:10] Spongebob: Yeah, it's weird. I'd take the photo down but it seems to get a lot of attention
[06/09/2019, 11:00:22] Spongebob: Indeed, and he* was :) his name was Jake
‚Äé[06/09/2019, 11:00:37] Sandy Cheeks: ‚Äé<attached: 00000072-PHOTO-2019-09-06-11-00-37.jpg>
[06/09/2019, 11:00:54] Sandy Cheeks: Awww what a cutie! Mines a boy too
[06/09/2019, 11:00:56] Sandy Cheeks: Muddy
[06/09/2019, 11:01:14] Spongebob: Holy shit who is HE
[06/09/2019, 11:01:18] Spongebob: He's adorable!
[06/09/2019, 11:01:21] Spongebob: From home?
[06/09/2019, 13:44:48] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah he‚Äôs in Sydney I miss him so much
[06/09/2019, 13:45:04] Sandy Cheeks: I hope he doesn‚Äôt die before I get home, he‚Äôs kind of old
[06/09/2019, 14:05:12] Spongebob: He's so cute look at that smile though
[06/09/2019, 14:05:24] Spongebob: He won't die they just go to a farm upstate
[06/09/2019, 14:05:25] Spongebob: How old is he?
[06/09/2019, 16:13:17] Sandy Cheeks: üíñüíñ they better
[06/09/2019, 16:13:27] Sandy Cheeks: He‚Äôs 15 we think but not sure because he‚Äôs a rescue
[06/09/2019, 16:13:43] Sandy Cheeks: But he‚Äôs doing okay health wise so ü§ûü§û
[06/09/2019, 18:36:06] Spongebob: Oh jeez, good innings
[06/09/2019, 18:36:42] Spongebob: I'm sure he'll make the big 2-0 in no time
[06/09/2019, 18:36:51] Spongebob: And by that I mean in 5 years
[06/09/2019, 19:30:34] Sandy Cheeks: I really hope so, my cat died like 6 weeks ago
[06/09/2019, 19:31:13] Sandy Cheeks: Okay I‚Äôm going to stop talking about my dead animals
[06/09/2019, 19:32:01] Sandy Cheeks: Where do you rock climbing by the way? My housemate goes to one in vauxhall!
[07/09/2019, 00:37:41] Spongebob: Shit man :( sorry to hear that
[07/09/2019, 00:37:58] Spongebob: I had three cats and a dog, went down to one cat in the space of 2 months
[07/09/2019, 00:38:04] Spongebob: It's tough but it happens
[07/09/2019, 00:38:10] Spongebob: Yeah, probably best
[07/09/2019, 00:38:48] Spongebob: I go to bermondsey arch! Also stronghold in North London but also vauxwall sometimes. Have you ever gone?
[07/09/2019, 00:39:33] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah I think our one died of a broken heart, his brother died a few months before and since that he was never the same
[07/09/2019, 00:40:15] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm sorry to hear that too though animals have a really special place in the family
[07/09/2019, 00:41:26] Sandy Cheeks: No I‚Äôve never gone, we did it for PE in high school for a term or two but since then I‚Äôve never done it! I‚Äôm kind of keen on trying it again
[07/09/2019, 00:41:33] Sandy Cheeks: It seems to be pretty popular here
[07/09/2019, 17:30:21] Spongebob: Hey! Sorry, I got very drunk last night and didn't realise I didn't reply!
[07/09/2019, 17:30:45] Spongebob: This is super sad but it happens, happened to my cat as well
[07/09/2019, 17:33:04] Spongebob: It's crack for me at the minute, got hooked on it at the start of the year. I'll drag you along to it in no time don't you worry üåù
[07/09/2019, 17:33:27] Spongebob: What time do you want to meet tomorrow? I'll probably be climbing until around midday I expect
[07/09/2019, 18:44:48] Sandy Cheeks: Hahaha it‚Äôs okay a Friday night well spent!
[07/09/2019, 18:44:55] Sandy Cheeks: Don‚Äôt tell me you just woke up..
[07/09/2019, 19:10:11] Sandy Cheeks: Okay so, my dad and I are seeing a matinee tomorrow at 2:30 but maybe afterwards we could have a drink?
[07/09/2019, 19:10:57] Sandy Cheeks: No sausage dog though, ill have to save him as a bribe for a second date
[07/09/2019, 19:43:51] Spongebob: If I said no would that be okay?
[07/09/2019, 19:44:29] Spongebob: Also because I didn't so that's always good
[07/09/2019, 19:44:34] Spongebob: Woke up alarmingly early which is never great
[07/09/2019, 19:44:40] Spongebob: Nice, what are you seeing?
[07/09/2019, 19:44:53] Spongebob: Yeah, a late afternoon drink could be nice :)
[07/09/2019, 19:45:03] Spongebob: This...works
[07/09/2019, 20:05:50] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm really sorry! He booked it without me knowing, we were supposed to go on Friday night but everything was sold out
[07/09/2019, 20:05:58] Sandy Cheeks: Lion king!
[07/09/2019, 20:06:22] Sandy Cheeks: So should be done no later than 5
[07/09/2019, 20:23:08] Spongebob: No worries! It's all good, Lion King is meant to be great too :)
[07/09/2019, 20:23:42] Spongebob: You'll be in Soho around then right? Fairly flexible on where to meet, somewhere central could work if not a bit south of the river?
[07/09/2019, 20:52:52] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah I‚Äôll be in soho but I‚Äôll have to make my way back to Balham anyway so we can meet further south? Where will you be?
[07/09/2019, 22:00:20] Spongebob: Nice one, we could meet somewhere on the northern line, maybe London Bridge?
[07/09/2019, 22:01:44] Spongebob: I'm in Canada Water, so fairly close to central south things
[07/09/2019, 23:35:57] Sandy Cheeks: Shit yep you did say that I remember now
[08/09/2019, 00:19:15] Sandy Cheeks: Okay why don‚Äôt I just message when I‚Äôm finished and we can figure something out?
[08/09/2019, 00:20:01] Sandy Cheeks: Also totally okay if you wanna wait until we have more time (and more dogs)
[08/09/2019, 00:20:55] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm free any night this week except for Monday when I will be accepting first place in our local pub qusandy
[08/09/2019, 00:32:03] Spongebob: Sounds good :) we can call it tomorrow! I'm happy for whatever but it also doesn't sound like the smoothest of days so if it makes sense to raincheck that's also okay
[08/09/2019, 00:32:38] Spongebob: I am a big fan of this despite it being problematic for my availability
[08/09/2019, 00:33:26] Spongebob: I'm off to France on Thursday till Sunday, then off to Japan for three weeks the following Saturday, so may have to wait until the week after next since I'm busy on Tuesday?
[08/09/2019, 00:34:29] Sandy Cheeks: Oh wow that‚Äôs so exciting!!
[08/09/2019, 00:34:46] Sandy Cheeks: Okay no let‚Äôs make tomorrow work we said we would and I don‚Äôt like flaking
[08/09/2019, 00:36:42] Sandy Cheeks: Even just one drink to meet each other
[08/09/2019, 00:40:02] Spongebob: You sure? I'm really hot on my social anxiety making me comfortable bailing
[08/09/2019, 00:40:28] Spongebob: But I am equally keen on meeting each other so we can do that
[08/09/2019, 00:40:46] Spongebob: I'll be hanging out at home so let me know when you're free x
[08/09/2019, 00:42:24] Sandy Cheeks: Good luck with bailing when I rock up at your own house
[08/09/2019, 00:42:48] Sandy Cheeks: But yeah I‚Äôll just see how late it is but like I said shouldn‚Äôt finish later than 5!
[08/09/2019, 00:43:04] Sandy Cheeks: Sleep well speak soon x
[08/09/2019, 00:43:22] Spongebob: I'm...interested?
[08/09/2019, 00:43:31] Spongebob: Sounds good :) night x
[08/09/2019, 13:14:11] Spongebob: Hey! So, I've just gotten back from climbing and the Sunday fatigue has smacked me right in the face
[08/09/2019, 13:17:21] Sandy Cheeks: Hey! I totally get it it‚Äôs all good! Let‚Äôs do next week?
[08/09/2019, 13:18:38] Spongebob: Awesome, that would be great :)
[08/09/2019, 13:19:35] Spongebob: I'm busy as all heck next week since I go to France, but the week after during the week?
[08/09/2019, 13:19:43] Spongebob: Have fun at Lion King by the way!
[08/09/2019, 13:45:21] Sandy Cheeks: Sorry yeah I meant next next week!
[08/09/2019, 13:45:45] Sandy Cheeks: Thanks! Im sure it will be a roaring good time
[08/09/2019, 13:45:51] Sandy Cheeks: (Insert laughing track)
[08/09/2019, 14:08:29] Spongebob: üôå
[08/09/2019, 14:08:51] Spongebob: Yes this was very good
[08/09/2019, 14:09:03] Spongebob: I'd be lion if I said the laughing track comment didn't make me chuckle
[08/09/2019, 14:09:36] Spongebob: (Insert one person in the back booing)
[08/09/2019, 17:48:35] Sandy Cheeks: HISSSSSS
[08/09/2019, 17:48:41] Sandy Cheeks: it was very good though
[08/09/2019, 17:48:56] Sandy Cheeks: I do love a good musical
[08/09/2019, 18:53:58] Spongebob: üêÖüêÜ
[08/09/2019, 18:54:34] Spongebob: Are you a theatre type? We can get through the Hamilton chat toute suite if so
[08/09/2019, 18:55:08] Sandy Cheeks: Yes I love the theatre! We tried to get tickets to Hamilton but it was super expensive if not sold out
[08/09/2019, 18:55:12] Sandy Cheeks: Have you seen it?
[08/09/2019, 18:56:35] Spongebob: Same! I'm a fiend for it
[08/09/2019, 18:56:41] Spongebob: I have seen it...twice
[08/09/2019, 18:56:50] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs that good?!
‚Äé[08/09/2019, 18:56:59] Spongebob: ‚Äé<attached: 00000163-PHOTO-2019-09-08-18-56-59.jpg>
[08/09/2019, 18:57:05] Sandy Cheeks: To be fair I‚Äôm seeing come from away again next weekend hahah
[08/09/2019, 18:57:11] Spongebob: It _is_ that good
[08/09/2019, 18:57:38] Spongebob: IT'S ALSO SO GOOD
[08/09/2019, 18:57:48] Spongebob: And very Canadian
[08/09/2019, 18:59:57] Sandy Cheeks: I cried like the whole time
[08/09/2019, 19:00:17] Sandy Cheeks: I actually have no idea what Hamilton is about but I kind of want to keep it that way
[08/09/2019, 19:01:14] Spongebob: Haha when did you see it?
[08/09/2019, 19:01:26] Spongebob: I wanted to hold it together near my fam but the end got me
[08/09/2019, 19:01:56] Spongebob: It's a weird one, I'd say think Babe (about the pig) but set in Mexico
[08/09/2019, 19:02:28] Sandy Cheeks: I saw it like 6 weeks ago, seriously one of the best shows I‚Äôve ever seen
[08/09/2019, 19:03:42] Sandy Cheeks: Don‚Äôt feel too bad I was sitting next to this massive scottish guy and he was audibly balling
[08/09/2019, 19:18:29] Spongebob: You're going to _love_ Hamilton
[08/09/2019, 19:18:46] Spongebob: Also Dear Evan Hansen comes in December and my body is not the only ready
[08/09/2019, 19:19:08] Spongebob: ...you sure this wasn't me? Because that sounds like me
[08/09/2019, 21:16:08] Sandy Cheeks: Never heard of this one but I‚Äôm intrigued
[08/09/2019, 21:16:37] Sandy Cheeks: Could‚Äôve been you but you‚Äôre not Scottish are you?
[08/09/2019, 21:51:43] Spongebob: I'll talk your ear off about it when we meet, don't worry
[08/09/2019, 21:53:05] Spongebob: I am not, and SURE I've gained weight since graduating but massive I am not
[08/09/2019, 21:54:02] Spongebob: What about films? What's your stance on the MCU and don't worry about how important the answer to this question is
[08/09/2019, 21:55:31] Sandy Cheeks: Okay so
[08/09/2019, 21:55:43] Sandy Cheeks: I only really care about Spider-Man
[08/09/2019, 21:58:09] Sandy Cheeks: And like I REALLY care about Spider Man, all of them (including into the multiverse but excluding the Andrew Garfield reboots)
[08/09/2019, 21:59:29] Sandy Cheeks: But apart from that I‚Äôm not a huge fan and I‚Äôm sorry if this means we don‚Äôt speak after this
[08/09/2019, 22:03:37] Spongebob: Right
[08/09/2019, 22:04:02] Spongebob: I won't argue for the Amazing Spiderman reboot because that wasn't great
[08/09/2019, 22:05:29] Spongebob: the classic Sam Raimi films are...films
[08/09/2019, 22:06:08] Spongebob: Into The Multiverse was incredible in so many ways, the art direction was perfect
[08/09/2019, 22:08:03] Spongebob: But to IGNORE the amazing storylines from Iron Man to the Avengers is, quite frankly, offensive
[08/09/2019, 22:08:34] Spongebob: I cried several times during Endgame, the first time at the midnight premiere
[08/09/2019, 22:08:58] Spongebob: So...yeah. I'm sorry if this means we don't speak after this
[08/09/2019, 22:09:41] Sandy Cheeks: We could see this as an opportunity
[08/09/2019, 22:11:01] Sandy Cheeks: To educate me and indoctrinate me into the wider world of the MCU
[08/09/2019, 22:14:16] Spongebob: So you're telling me first date is me delivering a PowerPoint presentation on the various merits of the MCU franchise?
[08/09/2019, 22:14:19] Spongebob: Because I'll do it
[08/09/2019, 22:16:37] Sandy Cheeks: I was thinking something more along the lines of watching one of them
[08/09/2019, 22:19:06] Spongebob: I'm not following
[08/09/2019, 22:19:18] Spongebob: You're saying you don't want a PowerPoint
[08/09/2019, 22:20:44] Spongebob: ...but yes that would be great
[08/09/2019, 22:21:07] Sandy Cheeks: Maybe a prezi???
[08/09/2019, 22:21:45] Sandy Cheeks: Also is there an official order in which to watch them all?
[08/09/2019, 22:23:19] Spongebob: Is this a presentation?
[08/09/2019, 22:23:33] Spongebob: I will be bringing my laser pointer
[08/09/2019, 22:24:19] Spongebob: Yes, and it's long man
[08/09/2019, 22:24:41] Spongebob: Do you have a favourite franchise?
[08/09/2019, 22:26:59] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah it‚Äôs a deck
[08/09/2019, 22:27:12] Sandy Cheeks: So I guess I‚Äôm just saying I want some deck
‚Äé[08/09/2019, 22:30:22] Spongebob: ‚Äé<attached: 00000210-GIF-2019-09-08-22-30-22.mp4>
[08/09/2019, 22:31:09] Spongebob: Well call me a deck because you can walk all over me
[08/09/2019, 22:33:53] Spongebob: On reflection, not as strong as initially hoped
[08/09/2019, 22:37:37] Sandy Cheeks: I chuckled not gonna lie
[08/09/2019, 22:39:15] Sandy Cheeks: But back to your question, favourite movie franchise would probably have to be Harry Potter
[08/09/2019, 22:39:28] Sandy Cheeks: But I‚Äôm not much of a movies gal I definitely prefer tv series
[08/09/2019, 22:41:03] Spongebob: What's Harry Potter?
[08/09/2019, 22:42:22] Spongebob: Yeah fair, me too these days. Are you watching anything at the minute?
[08/09/2019, 22:45:10] Sandy Cheeks: *minimises Glee torrent* no nothing at the minute
[08/09/2019, 22:45:54] Sandy Cheeks: Nah but I‚Äôm actually not because we haven‚Äôt got internet in the flat, waiting for our new box which comes on saturday
[08/09/2019, 22:46:28] Sandy Cheeks: I want to start peaky blinders but I keep ending up rewatching the office
[08/09/2019, 22:47:18] Spongebob: What's most problematic about this is the fact that I'm pretty sure Glee is on the UK Netflix
[08/09/2019, 22:47:51] Sandy Cheeks: Don‚Äôt act like you don‚Äôt know that for a fact and you aren‚Äôt 5 seasons deep in a binge
[08/09/2019, 22:47:50] Spongebob: Are you okay? I didn't realise there was a world outside the Internet
[08/09/2019, 22:48:08] Spongebob: Shut up you don't know my life
[08/09/2019, 22:48:44] Sandy Cheeks: Feel like pure shit just want mr schuster back
[08/09/2019, 22:48:47] Spongebob: I actually was recommended to (re) watch it recently, I gave it a good couple seasons before and liked it
[08/09/2019, 22:48:52] Spongebob: üòç
[08/09/2019, 22:49:00] Spongebob: Dank
[08/09/2019, 22:49:12] Spongebob: He didn't die, did he?
[08/09/2019, 22:49:27] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah it is fun it‚Äôs just a feel good show
[08/09/2019, 22:49:38] Sandy Cheeks: No he didn‚Äôt but he may as well have whilst I don‚Äôt have wifi
[08/09/2019, 22:50:07] Spongebob: I've heard of this new tech coming out
[08/09/2019, 22:50:35] Sandy Cheeks: But before this terrible thing happened to me I watched breaking bad, got, the OA, stranger things, black mirror etc etc
[08/09/2019, 22:50:38] Spongebob: It's like a phone but thicker and wider, and is made of this thing called "pages"
[08/09/2019, 22:50:45] Sandy Cheeks: Keep going
[08/09/2019, 22:50:55] Spongebob: Oh so you've watched the greatest show of all time
[08/09/2019, 22:51:18] Sandy Cheeks: Correct
[08/09/2019, 22:51:31] Spongebob: It has what we call "words" in "sentences" and, get this, you "read" it
[08/09/2019, 22:51:47] Spongebob: The q is which one am I referring to
[08/09/2019, 22:52:02] Sandy Cheeks: Don‚Äôt tell me
[08/09/2019, 22:52:05] Sandy Cheeks: I think I know
[08/09/2019, 22:53:33] Spongebob: You need need to know this is important to me that you get this right
[08/09/2019, 22:53:48] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs important to me too
[08/09/2019, 22:54:03] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôve definitely fucked up on the MCU front
[08/09/2019, 22:54:27] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôve put it down to two
[08/09/2019, 22:54:48] Spongebob: Alright
[08/09/2019, 22:54:50] Spongebob: Hit me
[08/09/2019, 22:54:55] Spongebob: Not physically
[08/09/2019, 22:55:05] Sandy Cheeks: I mean if you‚Äôre into that
[08/09/2019, 22:55:13] Sandy Cheeks: BB or the OA
[08/09/2019, 22:55:25] Sandy Cheeks: Tell me if I‚Äôm right
[08/09/2019, 22:55:35] Spongebob: It is _absolutely_ one of those
[08/09/2019, 22:56:27] Spongebob: You've reached $500,000 but the big milli is yet to come
[08/09/2019, 22:56:32] Sandy Cheeks: Have you seen both of them?
[08/09/2019, 22:56:55] Spongebob: Questions?? Is that allowed??
[08/09/2019, 22:56:58] Spongebob: (No)
[08/09/2019, 22:57:16] Sandy Cheeks: As in the answer is no
[08/09/2019, 22:57:21] Sandy Cheeks: Or questions aren‚Äôt allowed
[08/09/2019, 22:57:38] Spongebob: I feel so powerful
[08/09/2019, 22:57:42] Spongebob: The answer is no
[08/09/2019, 22:58:00] Sandy Cheeks: Breaking bad
‚Äé[08/09/2019, 22:58:19] Spongebob: ‚Äé<attached: 00000262-PHOTO-2019-09-08-22-58-19.jpg>
[08/09/2019, 22:58:33] Sandy Cheeks: FUCK
[08/09/2019, 22:58:43] Spongebob: No I'm just playing you're absolutely right
[08/09/2019, 22:59:06] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs the greatest show ever
[08/09/2019, 22:59:06] Spongebob: I rewatched it recently and it's still amazing
[08/09/2019, 22:59:09] Spongebob: Yes.
[08/09/2019, 22:59:10] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs literally perfect
[08/09/2019, 22:59:16] Spongebob: Omg
[08/09/2019, 22:59:29] Spongebob: You've officially made up for the MCU
[08/09/2019, 22:59:46] Spongebob: Turns out that Walter White guy? Real asshole
[08/09/2019, 23:00:00] Sandy Cheeks: I always thought so
[08/09/2019, 23:00:11] Spongebob: I didn't for a while
[08/09/2019, 23:00:33] Sandy Cheeks: Neither did my ex!!! And he hated skylar
[08/09/2019, 23:00:38] Spongebob: Watched for the second time and it's really clear
[08/09/2019, 23:00:40] Spongebob: Wellllll
[08/09/2019, 23:00:41] Sandy Cheeks: And I never thought she was that bad
[08/09/2019, 23:00:44] Sandy Cheeks: Oiiiii
[08/09/2019, 23:00:56] Sandy Cheeks: I think it‚Äôs a male thing
[08/09/2019, 23:01:00] Spongebob: Nah, Skylar was actually okay but yeah it is a male thing
[08/09/2019, 23:01:39] Spongebob: It's 100% the fact that men excuse toxic male behaviour, the same reason people relate to Bojack Horseman
[08/09/2019, 23:01:49] Spongebob: But on second watch I'm firmly on the other side
[08/09/2019, 23:02:51] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah exactly! I think at first you see it as pride but then on rewatch you see it as ego purely because you know the eventuality of the character development
[08/09/2019, 23:03:09] Spongebob: 100%, that's spot on
[08/09/2019, 23:03:21] Sandy Cheeks: Thanks I did English in high school
[08/09/2019, 23:03:38] Spongebob: Also, I really appreciated the nuances of Jesse Pinkman in the first few seasons
[08/09/2019, 23:04:07] Spongebob: I did English in real life
[08/09/2019, 23:04:09] Sandy Cheeks: I honestly have to rewatch it because I can‚Äôt remember anything subtle
[08/09/2019, 23:04:28] Sandy Cheeks: But I loved Jesse from the start
[08/09/2019, 23:04:31] Spongebob: That accidentally sounded like a diss
[08/09/2019, 23:04:39] Sandy Cheeks: Massive crush on Aron Paul
[08/09/2019, 23:04:42] Spongebob: DO it
[08/09/2019, 23:04:47] Sandy Cheeks: It wasn‚Äôt accidental you don‚Äôt have to pretend
[08/09/2019, 23:04:47] Spongebob: You should watch Bojack
[08/09/2019, 23:04:53] Spongebob: üåù
[08/09/2019, 23:05:21] Sandy Cheeks: How the fuck am I supposed to fit this all in to my BUSY schedule
[08/09/2019, 23:05:35] Sandy Cheeks: Which takes priority? MCU or BB
[08/09/2019, 23:05:48] Sandy Cheeks: a bit of a Sophie‚Äôs choice for you Spongebob
[08/09/2019, 23:06:09] Spongebob: Why are you asking me such questions this late on a Sunday
[08/09/2019, 23:06:29] Spongebob: That was actually in response to the second q but hey ho
[08/09/2019, 23:06:30] Spongebob: So
[08/09/2019, 23:06:38] Spongebob: MCU
[08/09/2019, 23:06:39] Spongebob: But
[08/09/2019, 23:07:42] Spongebob: MCU is ten years worth of blockbuster films, BB is a self-contained series that follows one narrative
[08/09/2019, 23:07:47] Spongebob: So make of that what you will
[08/09/2019, 23:08:05] Spongebob: What would you rather dive into?
[08/09/2019, 23:08:23] Sandy Cheeks: Well I‚Äôve seen one of them
[08/09/2019, 23:08:46] Sandy Cheeks: And I really should broaden my horsandyons
[08/09/2019, 23:09:02] Sandy Cheeks: So which MCU movie is first in order of watching?
[08/09/2019, 23:09:21] Spongebob: That's admirable
[08/09/2019, 23:09:36] Spongebob: So technically, Iron Man
[08/09/2019, 23:10:05] Spongebob: Other thing is do you have strong feelings on Robert Downey Jr, Chris Hemsworth etc etc
[08/09/2019, 23:10:14] Spongebob: He's one of you people so you have to like him
[08/09/2019, 23:11:18] Sandy Cheeks: I like Chris yes, I like RDJ too but like not a massive fan girl of either
[08/09/2019, 23:11:32] Sandy Cheeks: OH I do really like Chris Pratt
[08/09/2019, 23:11:40] Sandy Cheeks: And I loved GotG
[08/09/2019, 23:11:53] Sandy Cheeks: Tbf every MCU movie I‚Äôve watched I enjoyed
[08/09/2019, 23:12:07] Sandy Cheeks: And going through the list I‚Äôve seen quite a few
[08/09/2019, 23:12:24] Spongebob: You meant earlier that you rewatched the office, you meant the US one right?
[08/09/2019, 23:12:55] Spongebob: Okay this convo is going from good to even better
‚Äé[08/09/2019, 23:13:18] Sandy Cheeks: ‚Äé<attached: 00000321-GIF-2019-09-08-23-13-18.mp4>
[08/09/2019, 23:13:49] Sandy Cheeks: Like you have to ask
‚Äé[08/09/2019, 23:13:52] Spongebob: ‚Äé<attached: 00000323-GIF-2019-09-08-23-13-52.mp4>
[08/09/2019, 23:14:09] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm thinking of going as Dwight for Halloween
[08/09/2019, 23:14:23] Spongebob: Honestly I'm treating this conversation like our first date and it's going swimmingly
[08/09/2019, 23:14:30] Spongebob: That would be fantastic
[08/09/2019, 23:14:57] Spongebob: https://youtu.be/2H8ZAIxuyaw
[08/09/2019, 23:15:02] Spongebob: ^^ I'll wait
[08/09/2019, 23:15:12] Spongebob: / watch it again myself
[08/09/2019, 23:15:33] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs so good that I‚Äôm willing to use my phone data on it
[08/09/2019, 23:17:36] Spongebob: God I could watch it all again
[08/09/2019, 23:18:08] Spongebob: I'm very much a split Jim / Michael type by the way, the sooner you know that the better
[08/09/2019, 23:18:40] Spongebob: With a hint of Andy Bernard
[08/09/2019, 23:20:12] Sandy Cheeks: THE NARD DOG
[08/09/2019, 23:20:41] Sandy Cheeks: Michael is my fave but tbh I think Jim can be a bit of an asshole
[08/09/2019, 23:20:49] Sandy Cheeks: But still love him
[08/09/2019, 23:20:59] Sandy Cheeks: Okay so how do you feel about this
‚Äé[08/09/2019, 23:21:07] Sandy Cheeks: ‚Äé<attached: 00000338-PHOTO-2019-09-08-23-21-07.jpg>
‚Äé[08/09/2019, 23:21:21] Spongebob: ‚Äé<attached: 00000339-GIF-2019-09-08-23-21-21.mp4>
[08/09/2019, 23:22:16] Spongebob: ^^ What was initially a reference to the Nard Dog wonderfully suited my response to that
[08/09/2019, 23:22:28] Spongebob: It's technically the first film to watch, yeah
[08/09/2019, 23:22:39] Sandy Cheeks: I was gonna say perfect gif timing
[08/09/2019, 23:22:41] Spongebob: And although not the best one is not a bad one
[08/09/2019, 23:22:56] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôve already seen it though so we could just go straight to iron man?
[08/09/2019, 23:23:05] Sandy Cheeks: But I can‚Äôt remember that much of it
[08/09/2019, 23:23:19] Spongebob: If we skip over Captain Marvel (which we probably should) then yes
[08/09/2019, 23:23:45] Spongebob: Captain Marvel was set in the 90s but it's almost entirely inconsequential to the overall plot
[08/09/2019, 23:24:11] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah not wasting 120 mins on Brie Larson
[08/09/2019, 23:24:12] Sandy Cheeks: Oh
[08/09/2019, 23:24:26] Spongebob: Up to you, just don't assume the first Captain America to be the gold standard of Marvel quality
[08/09/2019, 23:24:33] Spongebob: Have you seen Room?
[08/09/2019, 23:24:40] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah and I loved it!
[08/09/2019, 23:24:52] Spongebob: Well then EAT YOUR WORDS
[08/09/2019, 23:25:03] Spongebob: But also that is a SENSIBLE DECISION
[08/09/2019, 23:25:16] Sandy Cheeks: But she is so fucking annoying in real life that I can‚Äôt help but see her real personality come through in her acting
[08/09/2019, 23:25:29] Sandy Cheeks: I saw room when she was still kind of a no one
[08/09/2019, 23:25:48] Spongebob: So, you're saying you saw her before she was cool?
[08/09/2019, 23:25:54] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah
[08/09/2019, 23:26:01] Sandy Cheeks: Also I‚Äôm not like other girls
[08/09/2019, 23:26:10] Spongebob: Wow
[08/09/2019, 23:26:23] Sandy Cheeks: ANYWAY
[08/09/2019, 23:26:26] Spongebob: Haha
[08/09/2019, 23:26:49] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm gonna just watch captain America again for *personal reasons*
[08/09/2019, 23:27:17] Sandy Cheeks: Just to make sure I didn‚Äôt miss anything you know??
‚Äé[08/09/2019, 23:27:23] Spongebob: ‚Äé<attached: 00000365-PHOTO-2019-09-08-23-27-23.jpg>
[08/09/2019, 23:27:28] Spongebob: ...yeah, same
[08/09/2019, 23:27:46] Spongebob: And don't you ask me what I Googled
[08/09/2019, 23:27:56] Sandy Cheeks: HAHA
‚Äé[08/09/2019, 23:28:00] Spongebob: ‚Äé<attached: 00000369-PHOTO-2019-09-08-23-28-00.jpg>
[08/09/2019, 23:28:34] Sandy Cheeks: No context hinge match conversations
[08/09/2019, 23:28:40] Spongebob: Hahaha
[08/09/2019, 23:28:53] Spongebob: Away to reddit this goes
[08/09/2019, 23:29:04] Sandy Cheeks: I still see him as the human torch
[08/09/2019, 23:29:12] Spongebob: "I don't know the MCU"
[08/09/2019, 23:29:15] Sandy Cheeks: Told you I wasn‚Äôt like other girls
[08/09/2019, 23:29:25] Sandy Cheeks: is F4 MCU?
[08/09/2019, 23:29:32] Spongebob: "Clearly knows it well enough to remember the F4"
[08/09/2019, 23:29:40] Spongebob: Well no, but it's Marvel
[08/09/2019, 23:29:50] Spongebob: And it's Jessica Alba so it's seated into my brain
[08/09/2019, 23:29:57] Sandy Cheeks: Important distinction? Genuine question
[08/09/2019, 23:30:01] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah was gonna say
[08/09/2019, 23:30:06] Sandy Cheeks: What a goddess
[08/09/2019, 23:30:23] Spongebob: Yeah, do you know about the situation with Marvel and Sony and Spiderman?
[08/09/2019, 23:30:42] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah kind of but I also don‚Äôt really understand it
[08/09/2019, 23:31:38] Sandy Cheeks: Enlighten me!
[08/09/2019, 23:31:52] Spongebob: Well that's kind of about the same thing. Tldr incoming
[08/09/2019, 23:32:00] Sandy Cheeks: Hit me
[08/09/2019, 23:32:08] Sandy Cheeks: (I‚Äôm into it)
‚Äé[08/09/2019, 23:32:27] Spongebob: ‚Äé<attached: 00000389-GIF-2019-09-08-23-32-27.mp4>
[08/09/2019, 23:33:52] Spongebob: Marvel, who own all their superheroes, started making films themselves, beginning with Iron Man. This was after the older Spiderman films, because the rights to make those films were bought by Sony. Sony-made films, like F4 (I think) aren't MCU films as they're not mare by Marvel
[08/09/2019, 23:34:22] Spongebob: That's why films like Venom have come out recently but make no mention of other Marvel stuff, since it was made by Sony
‚Äé[08/09/2019, 23:34:26] Sandy Cheeks: ‚Äé<attached: 00000392-GIF-2019-09-08-23-34-26.mp4>
[08/09/2019, 23:34:59] Sandy Cheeks: Okay
[08/09/2019, 23:35:04] Sandy Cheeks: Give me a second to digest
[08/09/2019, 23:35:07] Spongebob: Sony and Disney (who bought the Marvel movies recently) struck a deal which allowed new films to be made in the MCU with Sony
[08/09/2019, 23:35:10] Spongebob: I'M NOT DONE
[08/09/2019, 23:35:16] Sandy Cheeks: fuCK
[08/09/2019, 23:35:44] Spongebob: That deal fell through after the release of the new spoodermanz film (far from home) meaning Spiderman is out of the MCU for now
[08/09/2019, 23:36:00] Spongebob: ...and, _breathe_
[08/09/2019, 23:36:38] Sandy Cheeks: Okay as in, Spider-Man is no longer allowed to be part of the story?
[08/09/2019, 23:36:59] Sandy Cheeks: Like the whole endgame fall out plot line?
[08/09/2019, 23:37:00] Spongebob: Correct
[08/09/2019, 23:37:06] Spongebob: CORRECT
‚Äé[08/09/2019, 23:37:32] Spongebob: ‚Äé<attached: 00000404-GIF-2019-09-08-23-37-31.mp4>
[08/09/2019, 23:37:37] Sandy Cheeks: So the avengers franchise can‚Äôt have him in their films?
[08/09/2019, 23:37:45] Spongebob: SI SE√ëORITA
[08/09/2019, 23:38:06] Sandy Cheeks: and the Tom Holland Spider-Man franchise can‚Äôt be finished?
[08/09/2019, 23:38:31] Spongebob: Oui madame Tussauds
[08/09/2019, 23:38:39] Sandy Cheeks: That actually sucks wtf
[08/09/2019, 23:38:42] Sandy Cheeks: Now I‚Äôm angry
[08/09/2019, 23:38:44] Spongebob: Which is a big fat tragedy
[08/09/2019, 23:38:56] Sandy Cheeks: Will it be resolved do you reckon?
[08/09/2019, 23:39:03] Spongebob: Welcome to my and every neckbeards world
[08/09/2019, 23:39:14] Spongebob: I reckon they have to, too much money is in the table
[08/09/2019, 23:39:23] Spongebob: Did you watch far from home?
[08/09/2019, 23:40:01] Sandy Cheeks: Of course!!
[08/09/2019, 23:40:30] Sandy Cheeks: Jake Gyllenhaal is one of my favourite actors too
[08/09/2019, 23:40:43] Sandy Cheeks: Not as good as homecoming but that was gonna be hard to beat
[08/09/2019, 23:40:46] Spongebob: I'm getting worried how compatible we are
[08/09/2019, 23:41:11] Sandy Cheeks: Prisoners is one of the best thrillers of all time
[08/09/2019, 23:41:49] Spongebob: You know what, I haven't seen it
[08/09/2019, 23:42:06] Sandy Cheeks: FINALLY something the man hasn‚Äôt watched
[08/09/2019, 23:42:10] Spongebob: Hahaha
[08/09/2019, 23:42:22] Spongebob: I felt weird admitting it
[08/09/2019, 23:42:27] Sandy Cheeks: To be fair you haven‚Äôt seen the OA either but if you‚Äôre not into sci fi you might not be into it
[08/09/2019, 23:42:52] Sandy Cheeks: Or you‚Äôre either way nerdier than I thought and you like your sci-fi too
[08/09/2019, 23:42:59] Spongebob: I'm not as much as I'd like to be
[08/09/2019, 23:43:10] Sandy Cheeks: What does that even mean
[08/09/2019, 23:43:21] Sandy Cheeks: Who is stopping you from watching sci-fi Spongebob!
[08/09/2019, 23:43:26] Spongebob: It means I am _absolutely_ way nerdier than you thought
[08/09/2019, 23:43:31] Spongebob: I don't want to talk about it
[08/09/2019, 23:43:53] Sandy Cheeks: What‚Äôs something really nerdy that might scare me off
[08/09/2019, 23:43:56] Spongebob: Nah as in I have guilt about not loving star wars, since I feel like I don't appreciate it
[08/09/2019, 23:44:20] Spongebob: Besides me very openly expressing my MCU obsession?
[08/09/2019, 23:44:39] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah but that‚Äôs pretty basic
[08/09/2019, 23:44:46] Spongebob: Basic
[08/09/2019, 23:44:50] Spongebob: First of all how dare you
[08/09/2019, 23:45:05] Sandy Cheeks: Like my brother is an MCU fiend and he‚Äôs a really blokey bloke max 3 brain cells
[08/09/2019, 23:45:13] Spongebob: Second of all how _dare_ you
[08/09/2019, 23:45:21] Spongebob: Okay fair
[08/09/2019, 23:45:22] Spongebob: So
[08/09/2019, 23:45:28] Spongebob: To put it mildly
[08/09/2019, 23:45:33] Spongebob: I'm a fan of video games
[08/09/2019, 23:45:49] Sandy Cheeks: Oh my god
[08/09/2019, 23:45:54] Sandy Cheeks: How do I manage this
[08/09/2019, 23:45:58] Sandy Cheeks: Every time
[08/09/2019, 23:46:02] Spongebob: Shit
[08/09/2019, 23:46:08] Sandy Cheeks: I get a game boy
[08/09/2019, 23:46:13] Spongebob: It's been fun I guess while it lasted
[08/09/2019, 23:46:14] Sandy Cheeks: What do you play?
[08/09/2019, 23:46:27] Spongebob: Myself, apparently
[08/09/2019, 23:46:36] Sandy Cheeks: and me
[08/09/2019, 23:46:39] Sandy Cheeks: Like a fool
[08/09/2019, 23:46:45] Spongebob: Indeed
[08/09/2019, 23:46:47] Sandy Cheeks: Just get it over and done with
[08/09/2019, 23:46:52] Sandy Cheeks: Rip the bandaid off
[08/09/2019, 23:47:00] Spongebob: Ffs was gonna say the same thing
[08/09/2019, 23:47:03] Sandy Cheeks: Console or computer?
[08/09/2019, 23:47:08] Spongebob: ...both?
[08/09/2019, 23:47:13] Spongebob: I'm so so sorry
[08/09/2019, 23:47:24] Spongebob: Mostly computer god why did I bring this up
[08/09/2019, 23:47:27] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs... okay
[08/09/2019, 23:47:36] Sandy Cheeks: I need names
[08/09/2019, 23:47:46] Spongebob: I also have a pretty healthy social life and wide group of friends?
[08/09/2019, 23:47:54] Spongebob: They're all online or course
[08/09/2019, 23:47:58] Spongebob: (Joking)
[08/09/2019, 23:48:06] Spongebob: ((probably))
[08/09/2019, 23:48:29] Spongebob: Multilayer or single player?
[08/09/2019, 23:48:46] Sandy Cheeks: You keep putting of the name of the game(s) and I‚Äôm becoming increasingly worried
[08/09/2019, 23:48:48] Spongebob: Christ my typos are getting consistent
[08/09/2019, 23:48:56] Spongebob: IT'S FORTNITE OKAY
[08/09/2019, 23:49:02] Spongebob: No its not
[08/09/2019, 23:49:02] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs not
[08/09/2019, 23:49:13] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs way worse
[08/09/2019, 23:49:16] Spongebob: But I did play a bit of it with some pals today as a laugh
[08/09/2019, 23:49:24] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs league for sure
[08/09/2019, 23:49:26] Spongebob: My Little Pony online 2009
[08/09/2019, 23:49:32] Spongebob: Nah nah I'm not that bad
[08/09/2019, 23:49:46] Sandy Cheeks: Okay then we‚Äôre okay
[08/09/2019, 23:49:58] Spongebob: Dota and league suck your soul out of your heart
[08/09/2019, 23:50:12] Spongebob: I have enough vices already
[08/09/2019, 23:50:16] Sandy Cheeks: You‚Äôre absolutely 100% right
[08/09/2019, 23:50:32] Spongebob: Rocket League is my favourite, which you may have heard of
[08/09/2019, 23:50:38] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah that‚Äôs fun
[08/09/2019, 23:50:49] Sandy Cheeks: That‚Äôs the only acceptable league
[08/09/2019, 23:50:54] Spongebob: I've actually started playing minecraft with some pals, which is pretty fun
[08/09/2019, 23:50:56] Spongebob: I agree
[08/09/2019, 23:51:03] Spongebob: Sounds like you had a traumatic experience
[08/09/2019, 23:51:25] Sandy Cheeks: I honestly can‚Äôt even begin to explain
[08/09/2019, 23:51:27] Sandy Cheeks: Hahahah
[08/09/2019, 23:51:31] Sandy Cheeks: What else?
[08/09/2019, 23:51:47] Spongebob: Okay I'll go from multiplayer to single player
[08/09/2019, 23:51:54] Sandy Cheeks: Runescape
[08/09/2019, 23:52:06] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôd also categorise that as soul sucking
[08/09/2019, 23:52:42] Spongebob: MP: rocket league, minecraft, battle royale games (pubg, apex, fortnite), rainbow 6 siege, and a host of small silly games we'll sometimes play
[08/09/2019, 23:52:56] Spongebob: I can feel your view of me draining before my eyes
[08/09/2019, 23:53:12] Spongebob: Yeah none of those MMORPGs, life's too short for that
[08/09/2019, 23:53:22] Sandy Cheeks: Okay that‚Äôs fine then
[08/09/2019, 23:53:25] Spongebob: Not into world of warcraft or anything
[08/09/2019, 23:53:35] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs the escapism games that scare me
[08/09/2019, 23:53:53] Sandy Cheeks: Cause the people who play them are always running away from something
[08/09/2019, 23:53:53] Spongebob: Yeah I suck at those, can't escape well enough
[08/09/2019, 23:53:58] Sandy Cheeks: Hahahahah
[08/09/2019, 23:54:04] Sandy Cheeks: Single player ?!
[08/09/2019, 23:54:18] Spongebob: _breathes deeply_
[08/09/2019, 23:54:56] Sandy Cheeks: RIP IT OFF
[08/09/2019, 23:55:19] Spongebob: Dark souls 3 at the minute, Red Dead 2 (really need to finish it), My Friend Pedro, and  a game called Control too when I buy it soon
[08/09/2019, 23:55:25] Spongebob: And Borderlands  3 when it's out
[08/09/2019, 23:55:38] Spongebob: Mind you that's just what I'm able to get playing in the time that I game
[08/09/2019, 23:55:55] Spongebob: My library is full of half finished games that I'll never touch again
[08/09/2019, 23:56:03] Spongebob: I call them "my hopes and dreams"
[08/09/2019, 23:57:00] Sandy Cheeks: Okay I haven‚Äôt heard of most of them but they sound like mostly story modes?
[08/09/2019, 23:57:02] Spongebob: I'm mostly drawn to games I can compete in / win, so there's that I guess
[08/09/2019, 23:57:11] Spongebob: Yeah, primarily
[08/09/2019, 23:57:44] Sandy Cheeks: So not really into battlefield or anything along those lines?
[08/09/2019, 23:57:47] Spongebob: But, and I'm not just saying this for your sake, I don't sink into escapism games that well. I always try to but get distracted or fed up with how slow they are
[08/09/2019, 23:58:02] Spongebob: Nah, not really. Shooters are only fun with and against real people imo
[08/09/2019, 23:58:14] Spongebob: The stories are too JJ Abrams
[08/09/2019, 23:58:29] Spongebob: I also play fifa with my flatmate, but that's not really news
[08/09/2019, 23:59:32] Sandy Cheeks: That‚Äôs really interesting that you have that take on them
[08/09/2019, 23:59:49] Sandy Cheeks: But yeah look all in all not a bad score card!
[09/09/2019, 00:00:16] Sandy Cheeks: Not that it matters, I mean I don‚Äôt care and what I think shouldn‚Äôt matter anyway
[09/09/2019, 00:00:59] Spongebob: I feel like we've gotten to a point that it does matter, and that's totally okay
[09/09/2019, 00:01:11] Spongebob: I need B+ scores or higher though
[09/09/2019, 00:01:30] Sandy Cheeks: Hahaha aww that‚Äôs really sweet
[09/09/2019, 00:01:39] Sandy Cheeks: Well you get a B* from me
[09/09/2019, 00:01:58] Sandy Cheeks: B* doesn‚Äôt exist hang on
[09/09/2019, 00:02:16] Sandy Cheeks: A* too high
[09/09/2019, 00:02:18] Sandy Cheeks: A it is
[09/09/2019, 00:02:24] Spongebob: I should emphasise thst above all I'm just genuinely excited by the industry, much more so than I actually play
‚Äé[09/09/2019, 00:02:51] Spongebob: ‚Äé<attached: 00000531-GIF-2019-09-09-00-02-51.mp4>
[09/09/2019, 00:03:05] Spongebob: I'd like to thank my parents
[09/09/2019, 00:03:31] Spongebob: I feel like I need to ask - do you ever play?
[09/09/2019, 00:03:56] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah it‚Äôs a fascinating industry
[09/09/2019, 00:04:26] Sandy Cheeks: Does the interactive black mirror episode count? Or sims?
[09/09/2019, 00:05:05] Sandy Cheeks: No I haven‚Äôt I‚Äôve just watched past boyfriends play (I‚Äôve only had two don‚Äôt worry)
[09/09/2019, 00:05:28] Spongebob: I'll go with a maybe on that one dawg
[09/09/2019, 00:05:58] Spongebob: If it's any consolation my exes were never lower priority than my gaming
[09/09/2019, 00:06:37] Spongebob: To a degree I think the behaviour where the dude games while the girlfriend watches is not great for the girlfriend
[09/09/2019, 00:07:31] Sandy Cheeks: That is good to know because at times I definitely felt like summoners rift was a better option than hanging out with me
[09/09/2019, 00:07:43] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah I‚Äôd agree with that now looking back
[09/09/2019, 00:07:50] Spongebob: Having a healthy relationship with anything requires balance
[09/09/2019, 00:07:58] Spongebob: I actually don't know what that game is
[09/09/2019, 00:08:10] Spongebob: But moreover games like league etc literally ruin your life
[09/09/2019, 00:08:14] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs the map from league
[09/09/2019, 00:08:30] Spongebob: Oh, dang
[09/09/2019, 00:08:35] Sandy Cheeks: That‚Äôs how much I know about it without playing because he played it so much
[09/09/2019, 00:08:42] Spongebob: Hahaha...ha.
[09/09/2019, 00:08:55] Sandy Cheeks: Like we actually watched the world championships together
[09/09/2019, 00:08:58] Sandy Cheeks: I cringe now
[09/09/2019, 00:09:16] Spongebob: At worst, I'll be slow to reply to texts because I'll be hitting a football around with a car for five minutes
[09/09/2019, 00:09:48] Sandy Cheeks: Hahahah exactly!
[09/09/2019, 00:10:13] Spongebob: I actually don't mind this myself imo for some esports, but there's a lot of games where the pros are just 13 year olds with reflexes
[09/09/2019, 00:10:29] Spongebob: Not that rocket league isn't but that's not the point right now
[09/09/2019, 00:10:42] Sandy Cheeks: I think his worst was buying a $2K gaming computer a month out from coming over here when we were supposed to be saving up
[09/09/2019, 00:10:52] Spongebob: Ooft
[09/09/2019, 00:11:08] Spongebob: That's not a gaming problem that's a money management problem
[09/09/2019, 00:11:26] Spongebob: Actually I take that back
[09/09/2019, 00:11:30] Sandy Cheeks: That was one of many, many problems
[09/09/2019, 00:11:48] Spongebob: Relationships eh
[09/09/2019, 00:12:06] Sandy Cheeks: Eugh*
[09/09/2019, 00:12:14] Sandy Cheeks: She says to a guy she met on a dating app
[09/09/2019, 00:12:26] Sandy Cheeks: Hahah nah I mean it is what it is
‚Äé[09/09/2019, 00:12:32] Spongebob: ‚Äé<attached: 00000564-GIF-2019-09-09-00-12-32.mp4>
[09/09/2019, 00:12:49] Sandy Cheeks: And tbh my hinge experience has been way better than I expected so far!
[09/09/2019, 00:12:51] Spongebob: It's now my go to mood brightener
[09/09/2019, 00:13:05] Spongebob: Yeah, I actually met my ex on bumble as it happens
[09/09/2019, 00:13:28] Spongebob: Hinge is good, this conversation has been a particular stand-out though if I'm being honest
[09/09/2019, 00:13:42] Sandy Cheeks: ü•≥ü•≥
[09/09/2019, 00:13:45] Sandy Cheeks: Me too
[09/09/2019, 00:14:18] Spongebob: Just you WAIT till you see how much more awkward I am in real life
[09/09/2019, 00:14:33] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm excited!
[09/09/2019, 00:14:39] Sandy Cheeks: Genuinely am
[09/09/2019, 00:14:50] Sandy Cheeks: And I‚Äôm sure you won‚Äôt be that bad
[09/09/2019, 00:14:54] Spongebob: Me too
[09/09/2019, 00:15:21] Sandy Cheeks: I compensate for awkwardness with over sharing
[09/09/2019, 00:15:31] Spongebob: Oh, awesome
[09/09/2019, 00:15:44] Spongebob: Sounds like we'll be in good company then :)
[09/09/2019, 00:16:11] Sandy Cheeks: But you‚Äôll have a therapy dog
[09/09/2019, 00:16:15] Sandy Cheeks: So don‚Äôt worry too much
[09/09/2019, 00:16:18] Spongebob: Holy shit I forgot about the DOG
[09/09/2019, 00:16:24] Spongebob: Oh we'll be fine
[09/09/2019, 00:16:34] Sandy Cheeks: Well be fiiiineeee
[09/09/2019, 00:16:39] Sandy Cheeks: Have you had a hinge date yet?
[09/09/2019, 00:16:44] Spongebob: Yeah me and Otto will have a banging time
[09/09/2019, 00:16:59] Spongebob: And please do come with us you're seriously more than welcome
[09/09/2019, 00:17:12] Spongebob: I have, two dates with one person
[09/09/2019, 00:17:43] Sandy Cheeks: Funny! I can revoke your dog privileged at any time I see fit
[09/09/2019, 00:17:46] Spongebob: She was cool, but it didn't quite click after date 2 so it died out
[09/09/2019, 00:17:55] Spongebob: Please don't I need this
[09/09/2019, 00:18:10] Spongebob: I take it you haven't had a date yet?
[09/09/2019, 00:18:16] Sandy Cheeks: No I haven‚Äôt
[09/09/2019, 00:18:28] Sandy Cheeks: I was supposed to see this guy today but he bailed on me
[09/09/2019, 00:18:52] Spongebob: That's so funny because I was meant to see you tod...oh
[09/09/2019, 00:20:06] Sandy Cheeks: Nah it‚Äôs calm as you brits say
[09/09/2019, 00:20:08] Spongebob: I was hyped to meet your dad at the Lion King to be fair
[09/09/2019, 00:20:35] Spongebob: I should tell you I still sound mostly Canadian
[09/09/2019, 00:20:47] Spongebob: Which may or may not be a turn off
[09/09/2019, 00:20:56] Sandy Cheeks: Wait are you Canadian?
[09/09/2019, 00:21:03] Spongebob: Think Ryan Reynolds not Justin Bieber
[09/09/2019, 00:21:10] Sandy Cheeks: Is this a joke? Because you live in Canada water
[09/09/2019, 00:21:21] Spongebob: Yes! Is this not on my profile
[09/09/2019, 00:21:42] Spongebob: Yeah well it's got great transport links okay
[09/09/2019, 00:21:49] Sandy Cheeks: It is
[09/09/2019, 00:21:54] Sandy Cheeks: I just checked

[09/09/2019, 00:24:53] Spongebob: Si, hablo frencesca
[09/09/2019, 00:25:42] Spongebob: A little bit, was fluent but stopped learning when I was 11 so at best I sound like an 11 year old Frenchman with a bad memory
[09/09/2019, 00:26:33] Sandy Cheeks: Hahaha ahh okay well I can‚Äôt speak anything other than English so you‚Äôre still way ahead of me
[09/09/2019, 00:27:12] Sandy Cheeks: Having said that I‚Äôm gonna have to say bonne nuit
[09/09/2019, 00:27:23] Spongebob: Haha alright I'll take it
[09/09/2019, 00:27:31] Spongebob: Yeah this is outrageously late

[09/09/2019, 20:40:54] Sandy Cheeks: We took the bottom photo not knowing exactly where we were
[09/09/2019, 20:41:07] Sandy Cheeks: Then we watched it back and were like YOOO
[09/09/2019, 20:48:13] Spongebob: _You fucked Ted_
[09/09/2019, 20:48:26] Spongebob: What the fuck?!?! Dude!
[09/09/2019, 20:48:31] Spongebob: This is sick!!
[09/09/2019, 20:50:58] Spongebob: Your outfit is, like, only a little bit less sexy than his
[09/09/2019, 20:51:14] Spongebob: You should really invest in some tightey Walter Whiteys
[09/09/2019, 20:51:47] Spongebob: When were you there? I've always wanted to see New Mexico (guessing it's actually there)
[09/09/2019, 21:50:03] Sandy Cheeks: Oh my god
[09/09/2019, 21:50:07] Sandy Cheeks: That‚Äôs an idea and a half
[09/09/2019, 21:50:16] Sandy Cheeks: Pilot episode WW for Halloween
[09/09/2019, 21:53:19] Sandy Cheeks: I was there in 2017, it was sick
[09/09/2019, 21:54:30] Sandy Cheeks: We also went to Jesse and Janes house, the car wash, Walt‚Äôs house (which is totally barred off because people keep chucking psandyzas on the roof)
[09/09/2019, 22:21:42] Spongebob: Sorry can you not that's mine
[09/09/2019, 22:22:06] Spongebob: Although I would need to go clean shaven which I'm not willing to face
[09/09/2019, 22:22:28] Spongebob: That's so so cool, I'm crazy jealous
[09/09/2019, 22:22:33] Spongebob: Was it a themed holiday?
[09/09/2019, 22:23:08] Spongebob: Haha yeah,  I heard about this. Kinda gives that season 6 Heisenberg feel though?
[09/09/2019, 22:36:31] Spongebob: https://youtu.be/cFO44zUgc1A
[09/09/2019, 22:36:38] Spongebob: It's important that you see this, by the way
[09/09/2019, 22:47:57] Sandy Cheeks: No it wasn‚Äôt but my ex is really into film and tv so we tried to hit a few filming locations!
[09/09/2019, 22:48:14] Sandy Cheeks: Okay I‚Äôll watch it in a second
[09/09/2019, 22:48:18] Sandy Cheeks: Phone is about to die
[09/09/2019, 22:56:39] Spongebob: Ah gotcha, sounds awesome!
[09/09/2019, 22:57:31] Spongebob: Do it üôå ima head to bed momentarily but it's a real stunner
[09/09/2019, 22:57:43] Sandy Cheeks: I should go to bed too
[09/09/2019, 22:57:47] Sandy Cheeks: Today was a long one
[09/09/2019, 22:57:55] Spongebob: Oh yeah?
[09/09/2019, 22:58:16] Spongebob: I was up late last night chatting to someone so I was pooped all day
[09/09/2019, 22:58:39] Sandy Cheeks: Same
[09/09/2019, 22:58:46] Sandy Cheeks: And I vowed I wouldn‚Äôt do it again

[09/09/2019, 22:59:25] Sandy Cheeks: ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
[09/09/2019, 22:59:34] Spongebob: No we can't do this
[09/09/2019, 23:00:57] Spongebob: I'll be away for 3 weeks in a weeks time and if we keep this pace up we'll risk being dangerously low on conversation
[09/09/2019, 23:01:23] Spongebob: Although hopefully we'll have a dates worth of conversation to reflect on by then
[09/09/2019, 23:02:43] Sandy Cheeks: You‚Äôre right! Conversation is a finite resource! We must conserve it
[09/09/2019, 23:02:58] Sandy Cheeks: We haven‚Äôt even got started on music tastes smh
[09/09/2019, 23:03:09] Spongebob: Oh don't you dare bring music into this
[09/09/2019, 23:03:18] Spongebob: Not at 11pm
[09/09/2019, 23:03:32] Sandy Cheeks: I didn‚Äôt

[09/09/2019, 23:05:37] Spongebob: ...unless?
[09/09/2019, 23:06:08] Sandy Cheeks: I won‚Äôt argue with that
[09/09/2019, 23:06:56] Sandy Cheeks: But it‚Äôs going to be so awkward when I present you with a 2000 word proof on why the killers are in fact the greatest
[09/09/2019, 23:08:11] Spongebob: What, you think my 5000 column excel spreadsheet on why Skrillex is the modern day Mozart wouldn't top that?
[09/09/2019, 23:08:45] Spongebob: If were talking about music I'd tell you about how I saw The Killers at Glastonbury this year, and would even send you videos
[09/09/2019, 23:08:51] Sandy Cheeks: You know what they say a statistic speaks a thousand words
[09/09/2019, 23:09:03] Spongebob: But we're not doing that so that's fine
[09/09/2019, 23:09:09] Sandy Cheeks: They do put on a bloody good show
[09/09/2019, 23:09:22] Spongebob: Yeah they do, shame about the music though
[09/09/2019, 23:09:42] Spongebob: I'm joking please continue talking to me
[09/09/2019, 23:09:56] Sandy Cheeks: Honestly can‚Äôt tell if serious
[09/09/2019, 23:10:12] Spongebob: ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
[09/09/2019, 23:10:27] Sandy Cheeks: Don‚Äôt use him against me
[09/09/2019, 23:10:35] Sandy Cheeks: Thought you were going to bed champ??
[09/09/2019, 23:10:38] Spongebob: How dare you assume their gender
[09/09/2019, 23:10:46] Spongebob: Thought your phone was dying pal??
[09/09/2019, 23:10:57] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs on charge buddy
[09/09/2019, 23:11:35] Spongebob: I'm problematically engrossed in our conversations, homeboy
[09/09/2019, 23:12:06] Sandy Cheeks: I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm having this stand off with a real life Canadian
[09/09/2019, 23:12:29] Spongebob: I don't know what you expected
[09/09/2019, 23:12:35] Spongebob: But I'm sorry
[09/09/2019, 23:13:21] Spongebob: I can't immediately think of any Aussie stereotypes to fire back at you but _you just wait_
[09/09/2019, 23:13:47] Sandy Cheeks: I won‚Äôt hold my breath
[09/09/2019, 23:13:53] Spongebob: Good you'd die

[09/09/2019, 23:14:26] Sandy Cheeks: Mmm maybe too early for the black humour
[09/09/2019, 23:14:29] Spongebob: NO THAT'S THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT IS IDEAL
[09/09/2019, 23:14:37] Spongebob: Eh, I'm pretty into it

[09/09/2019, 23:19:54] Spongebob: I've made the front page once, and the top of other ones once or twice
[09/09/2019, 23:19:59] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah that was before it was like normal to get 30k +

[09/09/2019, 23:33:18] Sandy Cheeks: She‚Äôs the best
[09/09/2019, 23:33:20] Spongebob: Purely based on the fact that she's a redditor
[09/09/2019, 23:33:36] Spongebob: You're fine too so I guess that was a good play on her part
[09/09/2019, 23:34:31] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah she‚Äôs done okay I guess
[09/09/2019, 23:35:00] Sandy Cheeks: I feel bad! I‚Äôd give you mine but that would reveal way too much about me at this point
[09/09/2019, 23:35:05] Spongebob: I wasn't sure if we were at that level of banter but golly gee did I go for it
[09/09/2019, 23:35:41] Sandy Cheeks: I don‚Äôt offend easily so don‚Äôt hold back
[09/09/2019, 23:35:43] Spongebob: Dw, giving you my main acc was way too premature but I'm an idiot for using my real name on there anyways
[09/09/2019, 23:36:03] Sandy Cheeks: I use my nickname but not my full name
[09/09/2019, 23:36:54] Spongebob: Hmm
[09/09/2019, 23:36:59] Sandy Cheeks: Hahahaha
[09/09/2019, 23:37:04] Spongebob: Unfortunately that doesn't get me very far
[09/09/2019, 23:37:12] Sandy Cheeks: No it won‚Äôt
[09/09/2019, 23:37:43] Spongebob: I'm not angry I'm just disappointed
[09/09/2019, 23:38:56] Sandy Cheeks: You would be more disappointed if you saw my activity and that‚Äôs a fact
[09/09/2019, 23:39:43] Spongebob: What's great is that this is now my mission to get this out of you
[09/09/2019, 23:40:11] Sandy Cheeks: Orrrrr we could meet IRL and you could just get the same information out of me then?!
[09/09/2019, 23:40:13] Spongebob: You'll never see it coming until you slip up and pass it on
[09/09/2019, 23:40:21] Spongebob: How do you think I'll be getting it out of you?
[09/09/2019, 23:40:45] Spongebob: I am annoyed there's a wait to see you
[09/09/2019, 23:41:02] Sandy Cheeks: Four pint sandy is a different person
[09/09/2019, 23:41:21] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm annoyed too
[09/09/2019, 23:41:36] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs pretty inconsiderate of you if I‚Äôm honest
[09/09/2019, 23:41:56] Spongebob: Can't wait to meet her üëã
[09/09/2019, 23:42:10] Spongebob: Wow
[09/09/2019, 23:42:44] Spongebob: If you're insinuating I should cancel a trip to Japan to see you That's inconsiderate and fine give me a second to see what the cancellation fee is
[09/09/2019, 23:43:04] Spongebob: You don't have a spare couple Gs do you?
[09/09/2019, 23:43:15] Sandy Cheeks: That‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm insituating and I‚Äôm glad we‚Äôre on the same page

[09/09/2019, 23:44:15] Spongebob: Oh yeah forgot to ask, how was it?
[09/09/2019, 23:44:27] Spongebob: Did you bask in the glow of victory?

[09/09/2019, 23:44:38] Spongebob: Ah
[09/09/2019, 23:44:39] Sandy Cheeks: We came middle of the pack

[09/09/2019, 23:45:42] Spongebob: I'm good at very specific things
[09/09/2019, 23:45:59] Spongebob: Games where music is played and you have to recognise it is where I shine
[09/09/2019, 23:46:13] Spongebob: My party trick is hearing about 0.5 seconds of a song and being able to name it

[09/09/2019, 23:55:11] Sandy Cheeks: I read that like the vine
[09/09/2019, 23:55:15] Sandy Cheeks: Was that intended??
[09/09/2019, 23:55:28] Spongebob: I momentarily worried you didn't get the reference
[09/09/2019, 23:55:42] Sandy Cheeks: Alright now this is just silly
[09/09/2019, 23:56:03] Spongebob: Classic vines can be its own dedicated evening
[09/09/2019, 23:56:04] Sandy Cheeks: I won‚Äôt get into vine at 5 minutes to midnight

[09/09/2019, 23:56:20] Spongebob: I am actually alarmed
[09/09/2019, 23:57:27] Sandy Cheeks: This is the effect of having a photo of idubbz on my hinge profile
[09/09/2019, 23:57:36] Sandy Cheeks: Apparently
[09/09/2019, 23:58:03] Spongebob: Wait what where

[09/09/2019, 23:59:09] Spongebob: I do not see an idubbz
[09/09/2019, 23:59:35] Spongebob: His Content Cop videos are exceptional
‚Äé[09/09/2019, 23:59:38] Sandy Cheeks: ‚Äé<attached: 00000920-PHOTO-2019-09-09-23-59-38.jpg>
[09/09/2019, 23:59:46] Sandy Cheeks: üôåüôåüôåüôå

[10/09/2019, 00:00:34] Spongebob: üò©
[10/09/2019, 00:01:11] Sandy Cheeks: I actually think I might have changed like 4 of them
[10/09/2019, 00:01:30] Spongebob: I KNEW this was a catfish

[10/09/2019, 00:04:47] Spongebob: Yeah sounds good! I'll get my people to get in touch with your people
[10/09/2019, 00:05:29] Spongebob: Alternatively the more sensible shout would be for you to book some flights out but only see me once or twice because we can't be too keen
[10/09/2019, 00:05:35] Spongebob: Either way let me know
[10/09/2019, 00:05:45] Sandy Cheeks: alright sweet sounds like a plan

[10/09/2019, 13:39:25] Spongebob: So I've massively dropped the ball in not mentioning this sooner
[10/09/2019, 13:39:32] Spongebob: But have you heard of Aunty Donna?
[10/09/2019, 13:39:56] Sandy Cheeks: Is the pope catholic

[10/09/2019, 13:43:19] Spongebob: Saw their live show at the fringe a few years back. I've been obsessed with them years and years, listen to their podcast every week and everything
[10/09/2019, 13:44:04] Spongebob: I have the most awkward video of Broden taking my phone and filming himself, then panning to me and me sounding awkward as fuck
‚Äé[10/09/2019, 13:44:26] Spongebob: ‚Äé<attached: 00000961-PHOTO-2019-09-10-13-44-26.jpg>
[10/09/2019, 13:44:27] Sandy Cheeks: Well now I absolutely have to see it
[10/09/2019, 13:44:41] Spongebob: Nah that's like 4th or 5th date level
[10/09/2019, 13:45:01] Sandy Cheeks: They‚Äôre so funny! I feel like Canadians have a similar sense of humour to us
[10/09/2019, 13:45:08] Sandy Cheeks: Have you heard of Hamish and Andy as well?
[10/09/2019, 13:45:17] Spongebob: I feel like that's true
[10/09/2019, 13:45:27] Spongebob: I've got some new content for you to help prove that point
[10/09/2019, 13:45:32] Sandy Cheeks: that‚Äôs just extortion
[10/09/2019, 13:45:34] Spongebob: I haven't! Oz or Canada?
[10/09/2019, 13:45:40] Spongebob: yeah well
[10/09/2019, 13:46:10] Sandy Cheeks: They‚Äôre Australian, they were radio hosts but they‚Äôre so popular they‚Äôve made it onto tv and now have their own podcast
[10/09/2019, 13:47:00] Spongebob: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Vk3AvIX9w
[10/09/2019, 13:47:05] Sandy Cheeks: https://youtu.be/129pgG9vnXI
[10/09/2019, 13:47:09] Spongebob: When you get a chance ^^ A show about Canadian hillbillies
[10/09/2019, 13:47:16] Spongebob: On it
[10/09/2019, 13:47:19] Sandy Cheeks: Okay I‚Äôll watch it after school
[10/09/2019, 13:47:33] Sandy Cheeks: I have 13 mins left of break
[10/09/2019, 13:47:59] Spongebob: Okay make sure to study hard!!!
[10/09/2019, 13:48:10] Spongebob: Sorry I had a host of school-related jokes and failed at the first hurdle
[10/09/2019, 13:48:19] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah that was really shit
[10/09/2019, 13:48:24] Spongebob: Like, really bad
[10/09/2019, 13:48:55] Sandy Cheeks: I feel like I have to share this now
‚Äé[10/09/2019, 13:49:00] Sandy Cheeks: ‚Äé<attached: 00000983-PHOTO-2019-09-10-13-49-00.jpg>
[10/09/2019, 13:49:31] Spongebob: hahaha
[10/09/2019, 13:49:56] Sandy Cheeks: They didn‚Äôt reply for 4 days
[10/09/2019, 13:50:06] Spongebob: oh shit
[10/09/2019, 13:50:15] Sandy Cheeks: Anyway
[10/09/2019, 13:50:17] Spongebob: Maybe he didn't get the idea behind using double parentheses
[10/09/2019, 13:50:44] Sandy Cheeks: ((Lack of sense of humour intensifies))
[10/09/2019, 13:51:19] Spongebob: (((existential crisis deepens)))
[10/09/2019, 13:51:48] Sandy Cheeks: Wait
[10/09/2019, 13:52:24] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôve seen trailer park boys
[10/09/2019, 13:52:33] Spongebob: This is not that but good
[10/09/2019, 13:52:48] Spongebob: This is weirder. More flat but in a good way
[10/09/2019, 13:52:59] Sandy Cheeks: No I know it‚Äôs not but I was under the impression that it was a pretty niche genre
[10/09/2019, 13:53:04] Sandy Cheeks: Apparently not
[10/09/2019, 13:53:46] Spongebob: I'd say Letterkenny is really shaking up the scene, but it is fairly niche
[10/09/2019, 13:53:56] Spongebob: We only have about 5 hillbillies in the country so resources are lacking
[10/09/2019, 13:55:00] Sandy Cheeks: Social security and living standards are just too damn high
[10/09/2019, 13:55:06] Sandy Cheeks: Damn Trudeau !!
[10/09/2019, 13:55:33] Spongebob: I was going more along the route of dwindling overall population numbers but yes that too
[10/09/2019, 13:56:06] Spongebob: Darn him and his liberal stances on social issues *shakes fist*
[10/09/2019, 13:57:44] Sandy Cheeks: I didn‚Äôt know this
[10/09/2019, 13:57:59] Sandy Cheeks: So there are incentives for you to spawn more Canadians??
[10/09/2019, 13:58:04] Spongebob: On reflection, let's scrap the whole thing
[10/09/2019, 13:58:17] Sandy Cheeks: I want the truth
[10/09/2019, 13:58:36] Spongebob: I meant to convey that we have a low population compared to our space, in comparison to the UK for example
[10/09/2019, 13:58:45] Sandy Cheeks: Okay so
[10/09/2019, 13:59:00] Spongebob: But I phrased it poorly and ultimately made the whole thing a mess
[10/09/2019, 13:59:10] Sandy Cheeks: You aren‚Äôt being financially compensated by Justin to be on hinge
[10/09/2019, 13:59:17] Spongebob: Well not no
[10/09/2019, 13:59:33] Spongebob: I'm having serious placebo effect from a decaf coffee
[10/09/2019, 14:00:12] Sandy Cheeks: Well I gotta go back to class now
[10/09/2019, 14:00:24] Sandy Cheeks: But I hope you don‚Äôt get too crazy !!!!!
[10/09/2019, 14:00:34] Spongebob: I won't try another shit joke and risk more defamation
[10/09/2019, 14:00:55] Spongebob: No promises
[10/09/2019, 14:01:00] Spongebob: Have a good afternoon!
[10/09/2019, 14:10:21] Spongebob: Just finished that Hamish & Handy vid. Great stuff

[10/09/2019, 16:33:06] Sandy Cheeks: shit okay I‚Äôll get work
[10/09/2019, 16:39:21] Sandy Cheeks: Better be worth going over my data limit ü§ûü§ûü§û
[10/09/2019, 17:45:32] Spongebob: Sorry I got over excited I'm not sure if you could tell
[10/09/2019, 17:47:39] Sandy Cheeks: Are you kidding I love Evan
[10/09/2019, 17:47:56] Sandy Cheeks: He‚Äôs not Canadian is he??!
[10/09/2019, 18:09:10] Spongebob: He could be
[10/09/2019, 18:09:17] Spongebob: ...he's not but like, imagine
[10/09/2019, 18:10:09] Spongebob: Thoughts on the content or are you still in shock from how powerful it all is
[10/09/2019, 18:20:21] Sandy Cheeks: Okay look
[10/09/2019, 18:20:54] Sandy Cheeks: I haven‚Äôt had a chance to watch it because I have a life (honestly I‚Äôm surprised too)
[10/09/2019, 18:21:20] Sandy Cheeks: Nah I just got denied a pay rise so have been kind of bummed/on the phone with various people
[10/09/2019, 18:22:23] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm fine though really just surprised and disappointed and fucking livid hahaha
[10/09/2019, 18:23:58] Spongebob: Ah man
[10/09/2019, 18:23:59] Spongebob: Fuck
[10/09/2019, 18:24:08] Spongebob: Sorry to hear that, that seriously sucks
[10/09/2019, 18:24:44] Sandy Cheeks: Nah I‚Äôm actually fine I‚Äôm gonna fight it hahah
[10/09/2019, 18:25:06] Spongebob: Yeah definitely do üëäü§õü§úüèª
[10/09/2019, 18:25:15] Spongebob: Don't read into the right hand being white it's not a racial issue
[10/09/2019, 18:25:41] Spongebob: If you need to resort to violence I have a great number for someone who can dispose of the body
[10/09/2019, 18:25:59] Sandy Cheeks: Awesome I‚Äôll definitely hit you up
[10/09/2019, 18:26:07] Sandy Cheeks: In the mean time the first round is on you
[10/09/2019, 18:26:15] Sandy Cheeks: And also the second
[10/09/2019, 18:26:50] Spongebob: That can be arranged
[10/09/2019, 18:26:54] Spongebob: The third though
[10/09/2019, 18:26:58] Spongebob: That one's on me
[10/09/2019, 18:27:10] Sandy Cheeks: Ahh you got it!
‚Äé[10/09/2019, 18:27:20] Spongebob: ‚Äé<attached: 00001047-PHOTO-2019-09-10-18-27-20.jpg>
[10/09/2019, 18:27:37] Sandy Cheeks: North????
[10/09/2019, 18:27:38] Sandy Cheeks: Like
[10/09/2019, 18:27:42] Sandy Cheeks: Of the river?????
[10/09/2019, 18:27:50] Spongebob: Yes it's a real place, I know
[10/09/2019, 18:27:56] Sandy Cheeks: ?????!!!?
[10/09/2019, 18:28:02] Spongebob: I had that reaction
[10/09/2019, 18:28:09] Spongebob: Just wait till I tell you about Scotland
[10/09/2019, 18:28:18] Sandy Cheeks: Whatland?
[10/09/2019, 18:28:29] Spongebob: Thatland up north?!?
[10/09/2019, 18:28:36] Sandy Cheeks: Is that like near hackney ?
[10/09/2019, 18:28:47] Spongebob: You know London Bridge right?
[10/09/2019, 18:28:52] Spongebob: It's like there but further up
[10/09/2019, 18:28:58] Sandy Cheeks: Ahhh yes gotcha
[10/09/2019, 18:29:04] Sandy Cheeks: But in all seriousness
[10/09/2019, 18:29:19] Spongebob: "Seriousness"
[10/09/2019, 18:29:22] Sandy Cheeks: You will be AMAZED at how bad I am at directions
[10/09/2019, 18:29:34] Sandy Cheeks: Like you‚Äôll literally think I‚Äôm taking the piss
[10/09/2019, 19:14:00] Spongebob: Haha, okay I will definitely not use this for my amusement on our first date
[10/09/2019, 23:18:59] Sandy Cheeks: It is funny though
[10/09/2019, 23:19:06] Sandy Cheeks: I encourage you to take full advantage
[10/09/2019, 23:27:06] Sandy Cheeks: And take advantage of being asleep before 12! You‚Äôre welcome!
[11/09/2019, 09:28:50] Spongebob: Good morning, here's an impractical way of transporting a car
‚Äé[11/09/2019, 09:28:57] Spongebob: ‚Äé<attached: 00001070-PHOTO-2019-09-11-09-28-57.jpg>
[11/09/2019, 09:29:38] Spongebob: Spongebob got surprisingly drunk last night
[11/09/2019, 09:29:49] Spongebob: Spongebob feels unnecessarily poor this morning
[11/09/2019, 09:29:57] Spongebob: Spongebob has some regrets
[11/09/2019, 09:30:13] Spongebob: How was your evening? Has work stopped being fucks?
[11/09/2019, 13:40:29] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs never a surprise with you
[11/09/2019, 13:41:13] Sandy Cheeks: (I‚Äôve never met you before but I‚Äôm just going to assume we‚Äôre all alcoholics)
[11/09/2019, 13:41:50] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah evening was good! Watched a star is born and was disappointed
[11/09/2019, 13:43:43] Sandy Cheeks: Work is a bit heavy today some kid in the other class shat himself ahahah
[11/09/2019, 14:18:30] Spongebob: I'll respond to that with a shut up with a slight sprinkle of you don't know my life
[11/09/2019, 14:18:46] Spongebob: Oh! ...oh
[11/09/2019, 14:19:02] Spongebob: I thought the story was mildly problematic in its depiction of suicide, but otherwise good
[11/09/2019, 14:19:35] Spongebob: Oh that's hot tell me more üî•üé©üí©üòà
[11/09/2019, 16:37:04] Sandy Cheeks: Yes I agree how so???
[11/09/2019, 16:37:20] Sandy Cheeks: Songs were good tbh but I just didn‚Äôt think the characters had a lot of depth or chemistry
[11/09/2019, 17:10:55] Spongebob: Well, don't paint your protagonist as somehow ultimately benefiting from their partners suicide, it sort of suggests that the suicide was therefore justified and kind of a good thing?
[11/09/2019, 17:11:34] Spongebob: I felt like her moment at the end was too "Look how strong I am, I've grown from the experience" which is not necessarily a healthy attitude
[11/09/2019, 17:12:04] Spongebob: Eh, I would do unspeakable things for a chance to smell Bradley Cooper so I felt summin
[11/09/2019, 17:35:05] Sandy Cheeks: Okay I‚Äôm glad you said it first
[11/09/2019, 17:35:18] Sandy Cheeks: I felt like I could smell his character through the screen
[11/09/2019, 17:35:26] Sandy Cheeks: But yeah I agree
[11/09/2019, 17:49:17] Sandy Cheeks: Also don‚Äôt just make the manager come in and go ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a piece of shit‚Äù and then next scene is his suicide
[11/09/2019, 17:49:55] Sandy Cheeks: I don‚Äôt know I just think for a 120 minute movie there was a lack of depth and build up to major character development
[11/09/2019, 19:43:49] Spongebob: One of my weirder fetishes for sure
[11/09/2019, 19:43:55] Spongebob: Yeah that's brutal
[11/09/2019, 19:44:00] Spongebob: Kind of 13 Reasons Why vibe, in a way
[11/09/2019, 19:44:27] Spongebob: I don't disagree with that. I do think though that similar arguments could be made for Once Upon A Time, and I seriously enjoyed that
[11/09/2019, 19:44:33] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah I know what you mean!
[11/09/2019, 19:44:44] Sandy Cheeks: I haven‚Äôt seen this one
[11/09/2019, 19:45:06] Spongebob: I'd argue it's worth watching, but definitely in the cinema
[11/09/2019, 19:45:17] Spongebob: Are you a Tarantino fan or do you have no taste for the higher arts?
[11/09/2019, 20:25:14] Sandy Cheeks: Hahaha I love Tarantino! I‚Äôd say we should see his new movie together but I think movies for a first date are a poor call
[11/09/2019, 20:54:21] Spongebob: Like, we shouldn't, but I feel like we'd be going because we both genuinely want to see it and not because we're avoiding the pains of social interaction
[11/09/2019, 20:54:35] Spongebob: That being said, maybe a date 2 or 3 thing
[11/09/2019, 20:54:57] Spongebob: iF wE mAkE iT tHaT fAr LOL!!1
[11/09/2019, 21:01:09] Sandy Cheeks: Okay let‚Äôs shoot for date 3 hahah
[11/09/2019, 21:02:16] Sandy Cheeks: Can we actually lock in next week though? What day were you free again??
[11/09/2019, 21:12:24] Sandy Cheeks: Biiiiiiig gap in replies here
[11/09/2019, 21:13:15] Spongebob: Oh give me a gosh darn second I'm cooking
[11/09/2019, 21:14:11] Spongebob: I'd send you a pic of what I'm making but it's actually shameful
[11/09/2019, 21:14:12] Spongebob: So
[11/09/2019, 21:14:14] Spongebob: Next week
[11/09/2019, 21:14:20] Spongebob: I would like to see you
[11/09/2019, 21:14:53] Spongebob: I'm free virtually all week - I was thinking about popping to the GP practice to sign up on Thursday but that can move
[11/09/2019, 21:15:19] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs spaghetti and ketchup for sure
[11/09/2019, 21:15:21] Spongebob: My flight on Saturday is midday meaning I'll need to leave for the airport around ~5am~ 9am je pense, so Friday could work!
[11/09/2019, 21:15:23] Sandy Cheeks: If so send noods
[11/09/2019, 21:15:26] Spongebob: Somebody touched it
[11/09/2019, 21:15:46] Spongebob: _nice_
[11/09/2019, 21:15:56] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah Friday would be good!!
[11/09/2019, 21:18:24] Spongebob: Great! It's booked in
[11/09/2019, 21:18:44] Spongebob: Next q - venue
[11/09/2019, 21:24:25] Sandy Cheeks: First q - are you willing to fly hungover
[11/09/2019, 21:26:57] Spongebob: Darn tootin'
[11/09/2019, 21:27:32] Spongebob: I do realise after suggesting Friday that that would be prime packing time however, so I'm just sorting logistics in my head
[11/09/2019, 21:33:49] Spongebob: Are you willing to teach hungover
[11/09/2019, 21:34:19] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm a veteran
‚Äé[11/09/2019, 21:38:57] Spongebob: ‚Äé<attached: 00001127-PHOTO-2019-09-11-21-38-57.jpg>
[11/09/2019, 21:39:08] Spongebob: Wednesday / Thursday then?
[11/09/2019, 21:39:16] Spongebob: Gives me Friday to pack, which is probably wise
[11/09/2019, 21:39:26] Sandy Cheeks: You would be an old school simpsons fan
[11/09/2019, 21:39:45] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah either or! Wednesday is sooner ‚ò∫
[11/09/2019, 21:42:38] Spongebob: I'm not actually but if it makes me cooler th- wait is that the AURORA BOREALIS
[11/09/2019, 21:43:04] Spongebob: Wednesday it is then ‚ú® something to look forward to on the humpday
[11/09/2019, 21:43:21] Spongebob: And no don't take it there
[11/09/2019, 21:43:33] Sandy Cheeks: Exactly! It‚Äôs basically the first night of the week that it‚Äôs acceptable to start binge drinking
[11/09/2019, 21:43:44] Spongebob: "Acceptable"
[11/09/2019, 21:43:57] Sandy Cheeks: Take what where? Not sure what you‚Äôre talking about? Could you explain?
[11/09/2019, 21:44:11] Spongebob: Yeah sure
[11/09/2019, 21:44:19] Spongebob: So "hump" is a term often related to sex
[11/09/2019, 21:44:21] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm serious
[11/09/2019, 21:44:27] Spongebob: Which is a thing that humans do
[11/09/2019, 21:44:29] Spongebob: Apparently
[11/09/2019, 21:44:37] Sandy Cheeks: Well I‚Äôm not married so
[11/09/2019, 21:44:45] Spongebob: So I was making a link to our date and "humping"
[11/09/2019, 21:44:50] Spongebob: Ah
[11/09/2019, 21:45:22] Spongebob: I wasn't like insinuating anything I'm a good Jewish boy
[11/09/2019, 21:47:50] Sandy Cheeks: Oh okay good glad we got that out of the way
[11/09/2019, 21:49:47] Sandy Cheeks: I watched this by the way and it‚Äôs a good one
[11/09/2019, 21:50:03] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm slowly working out your sense of humour
[11/09/2019, 21:50:03] Spongebob: Eat rocks
[11/09/2019, 21:50:11] Sandy Cheeks: Hahahahah
[11/09/2019, 21:50:23] Spongebob: Interesting
[11/09/2019, 21:50:31] Sandy Cheeks: I feel like we could go deeper and darker
[11/09/2019, 21:50:34] Spongebob: I thought it'd be fairly formed by now, but there's still more
[11/09/2019, 21:50:39] Spongebob: In almost every way yes
[11/09/2019, 21:50:48] Spongebob: Not racially of course I don't want that insinuated
[11/09/2019, 21:51:14] Spongebob: "You're fucking 10 ply bud" is one of the best insults ever to grace the English language
[11/09/2019, 21:51:25] Sandy Cheeks: And not sexually!!!! Of course
[11/09/2019, 21:51:28] Spongebob: No no no NO
[11/09/2019, 21:51:35] Spongebob: No one here was going down that route
[11/09/2019, 21:51:46] Spongebob: Out of the QUESTION I actually think it's yucky anways haha?
[11/09/2019, 21:52:16] Sandy Cheeks: There are so many good one liners
[11/09/2019, 21:52:27] Spongebob: it is a fine day What's it to ya
[11/09/2019, 21:52:35] Spongebob: Did you watch the yes yes yes yes yessssssss one
[11/09/2019, 21:53:05] Sandy Cheeks: Fuck no I missed it somehow could you relink?
[11/09/2019, 21:53:42] Sandy Cheeks: There are so many Aussie ones that I feel like you won‚Äôt find funny because they‚Äôre just too bsandyarre
[11/09/2019, 21:53:54] Sandy Cheeks: Definitely 4th dare I say 5th date material
[11/09/2019, 21:54:23] Spongebob: This one
[11/09/2019, 21:55:05] Spongebob: On a scale of Aunty Donna to 2 girls one cup what kind of bsandyarre are we talking
[11/09/2019, 21:55:11] Spongebob: Sorry to bring that into this
[11/09/2019, 21:55:28] Spongebob: Yeah that's when we take turns showing each other YouTube videos and the other person has to politely chuckle
[11/09/2019, 21:55:51] Sandy Cheeks: I got anxiety just envisioning that
[11/09/2019, 21:56:10] Sandy Cheeks: Okay I‚Äôll watch it in a second don‚Äôt let me forget
[11/09/2019, 21:57:25] Spongebob: I shan't
[11/09/2019, 21:57:30] Spongebob: What you up to?
[11/09/2019, 21:58:21] Sandy Cheeks: Waiting for this guy to send me through some photos of his dinner
[11/09/2019, 21:58:51] Sandy Cheeks: Taking his sweet Canadian time
[11/09/2019, 21:59:17] Spongebob: You realise I ate that sucka like 20 minutes ago
[11/09/2019, 21:59:22] Spongebob: All two wraps of it
[11/09/2019, 21:59:33] Sandy Cheeks: O
[11/09/2019, 21:59:34] Sandy Cheeks: Okay
[11/09/2019, 21:59:34] Spongebob: What was in the wraps I hear you cry?
[11/09/2019, 21:59:43] Spongebob: None of your goddamn business
[11/09/2019, 22:00:35] Spongebob: If you're so big and cool what did you have for dinner huh?
[11/09/2019, 22:05:31] Sandy Cheeks: You‚Äôre such a fuckin tease spongebob
[11/09/2019, 22:07:11] Sandy Cheeks: I had a salad thank you very much
[11/09/2019, 22:07:25] Sandy Cheeks: And falafel
[11/09/2019, 22:08:21] Spongebob: üåù
[11/09/2019, 22:08:27] Spongebob: Okay that sounds lovely
[11/09/2019, 22:08:49] Spongebob: ...have we done the are you veggie talk because I feel we did and you are and I can't remember it yet
[11/09/2019, 22:09:08] Spongebob: This is like a HUGE clue but you'll get to know how poor my memory is
[11/09/2019, 22:11:03] Sandy Cheeks: We haven‚Äôt done the veggie talk I don‚Äôt think
[11/09/2019, 22:11:17] Sandy Cheeks: Must be confusing me for one of your other hinge girls
[11/09/2019, 22:11:43] Sandy Cheeks: A clue referring to your dietary orientation??
[11/09/2019, 22:11:49] Sandy Cheeks: Or mine
[11/09/2019, 22:12:34] Spongebob: Okay, I'm prepared for it
[11/09/2019, 22:12:40] Spongebob: Sandy Cheeks,
[11/09/2019, 22:12:44] Spongebob: Will you
[11/09/2019, 22:12:50] Spongebob: Take me
[11/09/2019, 22:12:53] Spongebob: Spongebob Squarepants
[11/09/2019, 22:13:00] Spongebob: Through your dietary requirements
[11/09/2019, 22:13:10] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôd be honoured
[11/09/2019, 22:13:12] Sandy Cheeks: I
[11/09/2019, 22:13:14] Sandy Cheeks: Am
[11/09/2019, 22:13:16] Sandy Cheeks: A
[11/09/2019, 22:13:20] Sandy Cheeks: Veg
[11/09/2019, 22:13:22] Sandy Cheeks: An
[11/09/2019, 22:13:27] Sandy Cheeks: Sorry hahah
[11/09/2019, 22:13:33] Sandy Cheeks: But I‚Äôm not an asshole about it
[11/09/2019, 22:13:52] Spongebob: So am I when I'm not eating meat
[11/09/2019, 22:14:14] Spongebob: I should tell you that most of my closest friends are vegans / veggie so I'm used to being the odd one out
[11/09/2019, 22:14:49] Spongebob: Obviously you're a freak yadayada but you won't hear any complaints from me
[11/09/2019, 22:15:23] Sandy Cheeks: All good! I just want to know why you fucking hate cows but love dogs????
[11/09/2019, 22:15:37] Sandy Cheeks: Hahahah nah okay first and only dig
[11/09/2019, 22:16:10] Sandy Cheeks: Do you eat vegetarian ever?
‚Äé[11/09/2019, 22:18:15] Spongebob: ‚Äé<attached: 00001216-PHOTO-2019-09-11-22-18-15.jpg>
[11/09/2019, 22:19:11] Spongebob: Yeah, I try to. At Lush I used to be vegan / veggie during the week, at the minute my life is a bit too whacky to settle into a meat free diet, but it's on my bucket list of changes to make
[11/09/2019, 22:19:37] Spongebob: There's not really any good justifications for eating meat beyond convenience, I've just not been able to kick it yet
[11/09/2019, 22:19:56] Spongebob: I'm somewhat lactose intolorent so that does help in some ways
[11/09/2019, 22:20:05] Spongebob: Giving up eggs would be tough though
[11/09/2019, 22:21:31] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah I put it off for ages because it wasn‚Äôt convenient and I was worried about putting on weight because I had to eat more carbs
[11/09/2019, 22:22:50] Sandy Cheeks: But eventually I just started thinking about it more and more and I was like I just gotta bite the bullet
[11/09/2019, 22:23:52] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah that was a big one for me! Poached eggs were my go to
[11/09/2019, 22:24:24] Sandy Cheeks: Tofu scramble is pretty great though
[11/09/2019, 22:24:48] Spongebob: Hmm, yeah the diet balance for me is a big one and would definitely be the biggest challenge
[11/09/2019, 22:25:05] Spongebob: Date 752 can be you teaching me how to make filling and healthy vegan dinner
[11/09/2019, 22:25:32] Spongebob: My flatmate mostly just smothers vegan spread on bagels which I expect isn't part of your 5 a day
[11/09/2019, 22:25:38] Spongebob: üòç
[11/09/2019, 22:25:49] Spongebob: I don't know if I've tried this
[11/09/2019, 22:26:02] Spongebob: Were you veggie before?
[11/09/2019, 22:26:14] Sandy Cheeks: Are you very much into health and fitness then?
[11/09/2019, 22:26:50] Sandy Cheeks: I eat way better now that I cook more but at home peanut butter and toast was like 50% of my diet
‚Äé[11/09/2019, 22:27:35] Sandy Cheeks: ‚Äé<attached: 00001233-PHOTO-2019-09-11-22-27-35.jpg>
[11/09/2019, 22:27:40] Sandy Cheeks: Deadset me
[11/09/2019, 22:28:23] Sandy Cheeks: No I wasn‚Äôt, I remember vividly having bacon and eggs for breakfast then just being like okay that‚Äôs it I might as well just do it now
[11/09/2019, 22:28:29] Sandy Cheeks: And went vegan
[11/09/2019, 22:28:33] Sandy Cheeks: Cold tofurky
[11/09/2019, 22:29:14] Spongebob: Sort of..I grew up in a very sporty / health focused environment, so I just absorbed it whilst also binging junk food as a protest
[11/09/2019, 22:29:42] Spongebob: You got any more of that peanut butter??
[11/09/2019, 22:29:52] Spongebob: Peanut butter is already 80% of my diet
[11/09/2019, 22:30:10] Spongebob: Wow man, that's genuinely impressive
[11/09/2019, 22:30:17] Sandy Cheeks: What‚Äôs your sport/s?
[11/09/2019, 22:30:19] Spongebob: You're a good vegan egg
[11/09/2019, 22:30:20] Sandy Cheeks: Yall*
[11/09/2019, 22:30:34] Spongebob: Don't you meme-shame me
[11/09/2019, 22:31:02] Spongebob: Me and Dave Chappelle go way back mon fr√®re
[11/09/2019, 22:31:08] Sandy Cheeks: You already misquoted Elf I thought it couldn‚Äôt get worse tbh
[11/09/2019, 22:31:25] Spongebob: That's true I realised after
[11/09/2019, 22:31:33] Spongebob: I said you sit on a bed of lies didn't I
[11/09/2019, 22:31:42] Spongebob: For that, I hate myself
[11/09/2019, 22:32:05] Spongebob: Road works ahead?? Uh Yeah, I sure HOPE it doesn't!
[11/09/2019, 22:32:15] Spongebob: Anyways I played rugby
[11/09/2019, 22:32:40] Sandy Cheeks: How dare you drew is an artist
[11/09/2019, 22:32:45] Sandy Cheeks: Union?
[11/09/2019, 22:32:49] Spongebob: And a lot of it, as well as ice hockey, some tennis, some squash, a bit of cricket and a few small others probs
[11/09/2019, 22:32:51] Spongebob: Yiss
[11/09/2019, 22:33:11] Spongebob: Tried out for team Canada at one point, gave up when I realised it was eFfOrT
[11/09/2019, 22:33:38] Sandy Cheeks: I was gonna say hockey but didn‚Äôt want to stereotype
[11/09/2019, 22:33:40] Spongebob: So what I'm trying to say is _I could've gone pro_
[11/09/2019, 22:33:54] Spongebob: *sips from 5th beer watching TV*
[11/09/2019, 22:34:09] Spongebob: It's fair if you're from Montreal
[11/09/2019, 22:34:24] Sandy Cheeks: Hahahah yeah well I never tried out for any professional sports team but I could have sooooo
[11/09/2019, 22:35:13] Sandy Cheeks: I didn‚Äôt know rugby was big in Canada though?
[11/09/2019, 22:35:18] Spongebob: I see what you're saying and I'm not upset I'm just hurt
[11/09/2019, 22:35:35] Spongebob: It kind of is, but I moved here when I was 11 so I got really into it then
[11/09/2019, 22:35:50] Sandy Cheeks: As in to the UK?
[11/09/2019, 22:35:52] Spongebob: Did you get into AFL or league?
[11/09/2019, 22:35:57] Spongebob: Aw yiss
[11/09/2019, 22:36:21] Spongebob: If it's of any importance I still sound like I just got off the plane
[11/09/2019, 22:36:49] Sandy Cheeks: Have you Canada-fished me with the false hope I was getting a nice Canadian accent?
[11/09/2019, 22:37:00] Sandy Cheeks: Ahh okay good very nice
[11/09/2019, 22:37:33] Sandy Cheeks: Not really afl as it‚Äôs more a Melbourne thing but yes league!
[11/09/2019, 22:37:58] Sandy Cheeks: But I still think afl is a great game
[11/09/2019, 22:39:44] Spongebob: No you're definitely getting a nice accent
[11/09/2019, 22:40:09] Spongebob: And by nice I mean squeaky and high pitched like all sexy Canadians are
[11/09/2019, 22:40:20] Spongebob: Ah nice! Who's your team?
[11/09/2019, 22:40:29] Spongebob: AFL is fucking crazy dude
[11/09/2019, 22:40:41] Spongebob: When I saw it I couldn't believe the athleticism
[11/09/2019, 22:40:57] Sandy Cheeks: Originally roosters but manly now since I moved to the beaches
[11/09/2019, 22:41:04] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah they‚Äôre insanely fit
[11/09/2019, 22:41:50] Sandy Cheeks: How often are you referred to as American??
‚Äé[11/09/2019, 22:42:15] Spongebob: ‚Äé<attached: 00001282-PHOTO-2019-09-11-22-42-15.jpg>
[11/09/2019, 22:42:32] Spongebob: Often
[11/09/2019, 22:42:48] Spongebob: Not problematically but like it's the first thing people think, which I guess is fair
[11/09/2019, 22:42:59] Spongebob: It in no way affects me though?? Haha??
[11/09/2019, 22:43:24] Spongebob: Nah it's chill, it's the most understandable mistake you could make so I can't blame them
[11/09/2019, 22:43:29] Sandy Cheeks: Okay see that‚Äôs the the thing with you Canadians too darn polite
[11/09/2019, 22:43:39] Spongebob: Sorry
[11/09/2019, 22:43:44] Sandy Cheeks: I always go for the Canadian route if I‚Äôm not sure
[11/09/2019, 22:43:49] Sandy Cheeks: Shut up
[11/09/2019, 22:43:56] Spongebob: Okay
[11/09/2019, 22:44:07] Spongebob: Yeah I mean it's safer in some ways
[11/09/2019, 22:44:10] Sandy Cheeks: But to be fair I‚Äôm pretty good at it now
[11/09/2019, 22:44:28] Spongebob: I can imagine in others some obnoxious American will get butt hurt but eh fuck em
[11/09/2019, 22:44:30] Spongebob: Oh yeah?
[11/09/2019, 22:44:31] Sandy Cheeks: Just get them to say ‚Äúout and about‚Äù
[11/09/2019, 22:44:42] Spongebob: Oh you mean oat and a boat
[11/09/2019, 22:44:53] Sandy Cheeks: That‚Äôs the one
[11/09/2019, 22:45:04] Sandy Cheeks: Do you reckon you can pick Aussies and kiwis really easily?
[11/09/2019, 22:45:35] Spongebob: Yeah, I think so
[11/09/2019, 22:45:51] Spongebob: It's more distinctive of a difference, I think
[11/09/2019, 22:46:37] Spongebob: I could tell an Aussie from a south African for sure, but Aussie / Kiwi would be a bit harder but definitely doable
[11/09/2019, 22:46:55] Spongebob: You all have a certain je ne sais quoi that separates them
[11/09/2019, 22:47:01] Spongebob: I assume you can right?
[11/09/2019, 22:52:54] Sandy Cheeks: Okay I‚Äôm going to have to ask you to stop speaking in French
[11/09/2019, 22:53:08] Sandy Cheeks: Because I keep closing the traslator tab
[11/09/2019, 22:53:13] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah I can
[11/09/2019, 22:53:20] Sandy Cheeks: Just get them to say fish and chips
[11/09/2019, 22:56:08] Spongebob: Je te donnerai une pomme de b√©b√© quand nous nous rencontrerons
[11/09/2019, 22:56:14] Spongebob: Fesh and chups
[11/09/2019, 22:56:23] Spongebob: Aw I'm beeched eees
[11/09/2019, 22:56:56] Spongebob: https://youtu.be/vmL72sgVdAQ
[11/09/2019, 22:57:15] Spongebob: Here's another slice of my humour circa 3 years ago for ya
[11/09/2019, 22:57:57] Sandy Cheeks: Farrrrksss sake
[11/09/2019, 22:58:10] Sandy Cheeks: These were the videos I was saving for date no 5
[11/09/2019, 22:58:19] Sandy Cheeks: Have you seen the big les show?
[11/09/2019, 22:58:34] Sandy Cheeks: We get it you‚Äôre going to France tomorrow
[11/09/2019, 22:58:35] Spongebob: Absofuckinglutely I have
[11/09/2019, 22:58:47] Spongebob: Did you notice?
[11/09/2019, 22:59:16] Spongebob: It's important that you're aware of how much I live on the Internet
[11/09/2019, 22:59:24] Spongebob: Which is fine because it appears that you do to
[11/09/2019, 23:04:24] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm just surprised you‚Äôve managed to infiltrate Australian meme culture with such ease and enthusiasm
[11/09/2019, 23:04:33] Sandy Cheeks: Impressed even
[11/09/2019, 23:04:53] Sandy Cheeks: I know nothing about Canadian memes what does that make me Spongebob????? Huh????
[11/09/2019, 23:05:27] Spongebob: The Internet has no Borders
[11/09/2019, 23:05:36] Spongebob: The Internet has no restrictions
[11/09/2019, 23:05:45] Spongebob: Wait
[11/09/2019, 23:05:49] Sandy Cheeks: Hmmmmm
[11/09/2019, 23:06:11] Sandy Cheeks: *Article 13*
[11/09/2019, 23:06:17] Spongebob: https://youtu.be/LkKKTsJZ5kU
[11/09/2019, 23:06:24] Spongebob: I'm assuming this is a childhood classic right
[11/09/2019, 23:06:37] Spongebob: I don't know, uncultured?
[11/09/2019, 23:06:47] Spongebob: What do you think I'm trying to do here?
[11/09/2019, 23:06:58] Sandy Cheeks: Seriously stop
[11/09/2019, 23:07:06] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs like you‚Äôve lived my life
[11/09/2019, 23:07:23] Spongebob: My friends and I used to quote that quite literally daily
[11/09/2019, 23:07:33] Spongebob: You ladies ready to have a good toim tonoit
[11/09/2019, 23:07:36] Spongebob: Aw Yeah FACK me
[11/09/2019, 23:07:36] Sandy Cheeks: YOU LOOK SEXXYY
[11/09/2019, 23:07:54] Sandy Cheeks: AW YEH LETS GET FUCKEN DRUNK
[11/09/2019, 23:07:56] Spongebob: Naww fuck STACEY she's a BITCH
[11/09/2019, 23:08:01] Spongebob: DRAAAAAAAANK
[11/09/2019, 23:08:08] Sandy Cheeks: Can‚Äôt wait to hear your Aussie accent
[11/09/2019, 23:08:17] Spongebob: I can't wait to not show it to you because I'm a coward
[11/09/2019, 23:08:26] Spongebob: Except when quoting Australian cartoons
[11/09/2019, 23:08:34] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs all good I‚Äôll as four pint Spongebob
[11/09/2019, 23:08:39] Sandy Cheeks: Ask
[11/09/2019, 23:08:47] Spongebob: Non
[11/09/2019, 23:08:51] Spongebob: Por favor
[11/09/2019, 23:08:54] Spongebob: I have a family
[11/09/2019, 23:13:06] Spongebob: We haven't established location for Wednesday by the waun
[11/09/2019, 23:13:08] Spongebob: Way
[11/09/2019, 23:13:24] Spongebob: I can speak to my local strip clubs and see if they can sort a table but I'm open to options
[11/09/2019, 23:13:25] Sandy Cheeks: Oh shit oh fk
[11/09/2019, 23:13:40] Spongebob: Also not that we need to I'm just being keen
[11/09/2019, 23:15:46] Sandy Cheeks: Okay well I‚Äôm thinking of doing something a bit original and out there
[11/09/2019, 23:16:58] Spongebob: Yes
[11/09/2019, 23:16:59] Sandy Cheeks: Get ready for this
[11/09/2019, 23:17:04] Spongebob: Yes
[11/09/2019, 23:17:09] Sandy Cheeks: Dinner and drinks???
[11/09/2019, 23:17:18] Spongebob: Yo what the FUCK chill
[11/09/2019, 23:17:27] Sandy Cheeks: Maybe go a little cRaZy and throw in some mini golf!!!!
[11/09/2019, 23:17:38] Spongebob: Bro
[11/09/2019, 23:17:44] Spongebob: Losing my freakin mind over here
[11/09/2019, 23:18:05] Spongebob: But yes that sounds great, with one clarification
[11/09/2019, 23:18:31] Spongebob: By dinner are you thinking restaurant sit down and order type vibe?
[11/09/2019, 23:18:49] Sandy Cheeks: No I think something more casual
[11/09/2019, 23:18:56] Sandy Cheeks: Sushi train or something?
[11/09/2019, 23:19:05] Spongebob: Yeah I could be keen for that
[11/09/2019, 23:19:22] Spongebob: At this point my expectation is that we will very likely get on well
[11/09/2019, 23:19:57] Spongebob: However I've not a done sit down dinner for a first date since there's that whole what-if-its-dumpster-fire chance
[11/09/2019, 23:20:42] Spongebob: However since I won't be able to see you for three weeks afterwards a more dArInG date works for me
[11/09/2019, 23:22:46] Sandy Cheeks: Exactly right it could go horribly and you could just fuck off to japan and never have to talk to me again!
[11/09/2019, 23:24:14] Spongebob: Haha imagine haha
[11/09/2019, 23:24:26] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs happened before
[11/09/2019, 23:24:30] Spongebob: Oh shee
[11/09/2019, 23:24:31] Sandy Cheeks: Another story for another time
[11/09/2019, 23:24:38] Sandy Cheeks: Nah it‚Äôs not what you think hahaha
[11/09/2019, 23:24:38] Spongebob: Like, this specific scenario?
[11/09/2019, 23:24:44] Sandy Cheeks: Noooo
[11/09/2019, 23:24:56] Spongebob: Well that's immediately less interesting
[11/09/2019, 23:25:09] Spongebob: Just kidding I look forward to getting it out of you
[11/09/2019, 23:25:22] Spongebob: Ugh that did not sound like the expression I had in my head
[11/09/2019, 23:26:35] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah you‚Äôll get it squarepants
[11/09/2019, 23:26:45] Spongebob: üòÆ
[11/09/2019, 23:27:17] Spongebob: ü§≠
[11/09/2019, 23:27:54] Sandy Cheeks: It so great I can pretend I‚Äôm talking to Ross
[11/09/2019, 23:28:03] Spongebob: Yeah that's FINE
[11/09/2019, 23:28:07] Spongebob: I'm FINE with that
[11/09/2019, 23:28:11] Spongebob: FINE
[11/09/2019, 23:28:11] Sandy Cheeks: Okay well maybe not sushi since you‚Äôre going to Japan? Tapas?
[11/09/2019, 23:28:19] Spongebob: Oh yeah good point
[11/09/2019, 23:28:25] Spongebob: Yeah Tapas works
[11/09/2019, 23:28:34] Spongebob: Surprisingly expensive though, if you didn't know already
[11/09/2019, 23:28:57] Spongebob: Another wild card could he Dinerama in Shoreditch, since it'll have options + beer
[11/09/2019, 23:29:09] Spongebob: There's two mini golf places in the area too
[11/09/2019, 23:29:32] Sandy Cheeks: Is that the one you showed me a photo of?
[11/09/2019, 23:29:36] Sandy Cheeks: That looks sick
[11/09/2019, 23:29:44] Spongebob: Hmm, I don't think so did I?
[11/09/2019, 23:30:21] Spongebob: Must be another one of your hinge boys
[11/09/2019, 23:30:30] Sandy Cheeks: Gooood one
‚Äé[11/09/2019, 23:31:25] Sandy Cheeks: ‚Äé<attached: 00001402-PHOTO-2019-09-11-23-31-25.jpg>
[11/09/2019, 23:31:34] Spongebob: Oh non
[11/09/2019, 23:31:47] Spongebob: Dinerama is like an open space that has loads of stalls
‚Äé[11/09/2019, 23:32:12] Spongebob: ‚Äé<attached: 00001405-PHOTO-2019-09-11-23-32-12.jpg>
[11/09/2019, 23:32:15] Sandy Cheeks: Oh okay I‚Äôve never heard of it
[11/09/2019, 23:32:20] Spongebob: I'm sure it'll be this mad on a Wednesday evening
[11/09/2019, 23:32:42] Spongebob: It's pretty cool last time I went, but depends on whether you want an actual sit down or not
[11/09/2019, 23:33:09] Spongebob: I'm happy for you to find somewhere üôå
[11/09/2019, 23:34:28] Sandy Cheeks: No that looks sick! I‚Äôm really chill so I‚Äôm easy with whatever
[11/09/2019, 23:34:48] Sandy Cheeks: Like so chill I‚Äôm prepared to get sloshed on a Wednesday night
[11/09/2019, 23:35:44] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm really not an alcoholic I‚Äôm just Australian
[11/09/2019, 23:35:55] Spongebob: Yeah let's get hammered until we work out how talk IRL that doesn't involve niche youtube videos from Australia
[11/09/2019, 23:36:19] Spongebob: I'm 15 years in a Brit so you're in good company
[11/09/2019, 23:37:01] Sandy Cheeks: Just a few more hours practicing facial expressions in the mirror and I‚Äôll be ready for an interaction I reckon
[11/09/2019, 23:37:12] Sandy Cheeks: By next week I should have it down
[11/09/2019, 23:37:50] Spongebob: Ah yes the Patrick Bateman philosophy I know it well
[11/09/2019, 23:38:40] Spongebob: I'm looking forward to it either way
[11/09/2019, 23:39:00] Sandy Cheeks: Same
[11/09/2019, 23:39:36] Sandy Cheeks: I hope it doesn‚Äôt go too well or I‚Äôll be disappointed that you won‚Äôt be here for three weeks
[11/09/2019, 23:39:46] Spongebob: Same, tbh
[11/09/2019, 23:39:52] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs for the rugby I‚Äôm assuming?
[11/09/2019, 23:40:04] Spongebob: Like, imagine if we get on as well in real life as we do over text
[11/09/2019, 23:40:06] Spongebob: It is indeed
[11/09/2019, 23:40:18] Spongebob: With my parents and just my parents, so I might not even survive
[11/09/2019, 23:40:22] Sandy Cheeks: Seriously just head down to clapham common there are always blokes kicking around a ball there
[11/09/2019, 23:40:32] Sandy Cheeks: Ohhh one of those trips
[11/09/2019, 23:41:20] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs such a strange dynamic going away with your parents as an adult
[11/09/2019, 23:41:25] Sandy Cheeks: It is for me anyway
[11/09/2019, 23:41:31] Spongebob: You're selling it
[11/09/2019, 23:41:36] Sandy Cheeks: It will be nice to see them though!
[11/09/2019, 23:42:14] Spongebob: It is definitely a strange dynamic. The whole reverting back to being a kid thing is very apparent, and made worse if your mum treats you like a child more than the average
[11/09/2019, 23:42:50] Spongebob: It'll be intense but also incredible, and I'm so lucky to get the chance to go :) and yeah, I'm actually looking forward to using it as a chance to get closer to my parents
[11/09/2019, 23:43:09] Spongebob: Apparently some people are more open to their parents ¬ø about their emotions ?
[11/09/2019, 23:43:29] Spongebob: Do you have any siblings by the way?
[11/09/2019, 23:44:10] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôve actually become way closer with my parents the last couple of years it‚Äôs been so nice!
[11/09/2019, 23:44:29] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm super close with my mum especially
[11/09/2019, 23:44:42] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah I have a brother! He‚Äôs the one in my hinge photo
[11/09/2019, 23:45:02] Sandy Cheeks: I think I uploaded it after we matched though I‚Äôll get it up
[11/09/2019, 23:45:47] Spongebob: That's awesome! It's really great when that happens, shedding the skin from your teens and all that

[11/09/2019, 23:46:27] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah exactly I really opened up to them after my first breakup
[11/09/2019, 23:47:19] Spongebob: Hot AND hilarious
[11/09/2019, 23:47:42] Spongebob: The picture not the post breakup sharing that would be weird
[11/09/2019, 23:47:52] Spongebob: _or would it_
[11/09/2019, 23:48:01] Spongebob: I'm actually bummed I can't see your new profile
[11/09/2019, 23:48:56] Spongebob: Not in a weird way just in a I want to obsessively see any updates and changes kind of way
[11/09/2019, 23:50:16] Sandy Cheeks: Who am I to hide that from you??!
[11/09/2019, 23:50:45] Sandy Cheeks: Tell me if you‚Äôd still match with me after the updates
[11/09/2019, 23:50:49] Sandy Cheeks: Curious to know
[11/09/2019, 23:50:58] Spongebob: Alright hmu famalam

[11/09/2019, 23:54:07] Sandy Cheeks: Fucking beat me to it
[11/09/2019, 23:54:49] Spongebob: Yeah so I'd match. You're cheating with idubbz but the Wandsworth Common line is particularly strong
[11/09/2019, 23:55:07] Spongebob: Also we both know that pic of you in the colourful top is a damn strong thirst trap
[11/09/2019, 23:55:13] Sandy Cheeks: Cheating in what way
[11/09/2019, 23:55:36] Sandy Cheeks: When guys like that photo I‚Äôm instantly like fuck off
[11/09/2019, 23:55:51] Spongebob: If I see idubbz I think that's pretty good and immediately match
[11/09/2019, 23:55:58] Spongebob: Or, I would, because that's never happened before
[11/09/2019, 23:56:02] Spongebob: Oh yeah?
[11/09/2019, 23:58:17] Sandy Cheeks: If you can‚Äôt handle me at my Ian you don‚Äôt deserve me at my night fever
[11/09/2019, 23:58:27] Sandy Cheeks: No but like
[11/09/2019, 23:58:43] Sandy Cheeks: It weeds out the scumbags
[11/09/2019, 23:58:47] Spongebob: üòç
[11/09/2019, 23:58:51] Spongebob: Oh I see
[11/09/2019, 23:58:58] Spongebob: So it's literally a thirst trap
[11/09/2019, 23:59:20] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs a test in a way I guess
[11/09/2019, 23:59:57] Sandy Cheeks: But it‚Äôs also a good photo so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄ
[12/09/2019, 00:00:11] Spongebob: I mean if it works it works

[12/09/2019, 00:04:00] Spongebob: Irl I'll give you a limp fist bump
[12/09/2019, 00:04:09] Spongebob: Which is coincidentally now going to be the name of my band
[12/09/2019, 00:04:39] Spongebob: Exclusively covers of Limp Biskit but with a self-deprecating twist
[12/09/2019, 00:05:07] Sandy Cheeks: Can I be your first groupie?
[12/09/2019, 00:05:21] Sandy Cheeks: Can you play anything by the way?
[12/09/2019, 00:05:27] Sandy Cheeks: Apart from women
[12/09/2019, 00:05:46] Spongebob: I mean yes
[12/09/2019, 00:05:51] Spongebob: I mean sort of
[12/09/2019, 00:05:55] Spongebob: I mean pls
[12/09/2019, 00:06:27] Spongebob: I drum mostly, but can dabble a tune on the piano and play the four chords medley on guitar
[12/09/2019, 00:06:43] Sandy Cheeks: You‚Äôre actually kiddinggggg
[12/09/2019, 00:07:00] Spongebob: I was very much into my music production and even #djayed for a few years until I lost all individuality
[12/09/2019, 00:07:15] Spongebob: Oh yeah axis of awesome, that's another Aussie bingo right?
[12/09/2019, 00:07:16] Sandy Cheeks: I too can cross fade on Spotify
[12/09/2019, 00:07:29] Spongebob: And don't get my started on Tim Minchin, the God almighty
[12/09/2019, 00:07:35] Spongebob: Sorry excuse me
[12/09/2019, 00:08:24] Sandy Cheeks: I have a massive soft spot for drummers
[12/09/2019, 00:09:32] Spongebob: It's because it's the best instrument
[12/09/2019, 00:09:45] Sandy Cheeks: I totally agree
[12/09/2019, 00:10:05] Sandy Cheeks: Unless you‚Äôre the neighbour of a 7 y/o who is learning for the first time
[12/09/2019, 00:10:38] Spongebob: Well yes but that's an oddly specific age and number to be giving as an example
[12/09/2019, 00:10:53] Spongebob: Did/do you ever play?
[12/09/2019, 00:11:27] Sandy Cheeks: No I can‚Äôt play anything
[12/09/2019, 00:11:54] Sandy Cheeks: I can sing though
[12/09/2019, 00:12:15] Sandy Cheeks: I tried learning guitar as a kid but hated practicing
[12/09/2019, 00:12:36] Spongebob: I give up
[12/09/2019, 00:12:39] Spongebob: You can sing
[12/09/2019, 00:12:49] Spongebob: Ffs
[12/09/2019, 00:13:32] Spongebob: Mum it's not funny anymore you can quit the account
[12/09/2019, 00:13:50] Sandy Cheeks: Hahahaha
[12/09/2019, 00:14:06] Sandy Cheeks: If you ever get me to sing in front of you though
[12/09/2019, 00:14:13] Sandy Cheeks: That‚Äôs a whole other ball game
[12/09/2019, 00:15:00] Spongebob: Why's that
[12/09/2019, 00:15:17] Spongebob: Why would you tell me if you didn't want that to be my sole goal of the entire evening
[12/09/2019, 00:15:32] Spongebob: Because it completely is now
[12/09/2019, 00:15:47] Sandy Cheeks: Well good luck to you sir!
[12/09/2019, 00:16:09] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôll sing if you play the drums for me
[12/09/2019, 00:16:59] Spongebob: Now THAT...would sound terrible
[12/09/2019, 00:17:35] Sandy Cheeks: Not at the same time Jesus
[12/09/2019, 00:17:35] Spongebob: I'm actually saving up for an electric kit, I've missed it and every time I get home I play until my hands hurt or I'm a pool of sweat
[12/09/2019, 00:17:58] Spongebob: Instructions unclear
[12/09/2019, 00:18:28] Sandy Cheeks: We could sing little drummer boy?
[12/09/2019, 00:18:50] Spongebob: Joking aside I have missed producing live vocals and need people to record stuff for me to inevitably ruin
[12/09/2019, 00:19:01] Spongebob: I've got these gifts for youuu they're up in my bum
[12/09/2019, 00:19:20] Sandy Cheeks: Or the start of welcome to the black parade

[12/09/2019, 00:21:48] Spongebob: I can work with that
[12/09/2019, 00:21:56] Spongebob: You said you were 80s right?
[12/09/2019, 00:22:06] Spongebob: Not age, of course
[12/09/2019, 00:22:26] Sandy Cheeks: Yes and 70s of course and 90s and 2000s

[12/09/2019, 00:30:11] Spongebob: So thanks, first of all
[12/09/2019, 00:30:14] Spongebob: It was a team effort
[12/09/2019, 00:30:54] Spongebob: Second of all, to say ABBA isn't in my normal listening rotation would risk causing tension between us so I might add some to make things easier
[12/09/2019, 00:31:11] Sandy Cheeks: Okay I understand
[12/09/2019, 00:31:26] Spongebob: It's also a group of 3 dudes who uphold a fake wall of machismo, so it may not have been the first call
[12/09/2019, 00:31:35] Sandy Cheeks: I disagree but understand
[12/09/2019, 00:31:38] Sandy Cheeks: Yep fair

[12/09/2019, 00:36:53] Sandy Cheeks: You like trap?? I‚Äôm going to together at printworks

[12/09/2019, 00:37:07] Spongebob: Who's playing? Not familiar but printworks is around the corner from me
[12/09/2019, 00:37:15] Spongebob: And I mean that somewhat literally
[12/09/2019, 00:37:25] Sandy Cheeks: Okay it‚Äôs more dubstep

[12/09/2019, 00:38:58] Spongebob: I meant it when I said Skrillex is our generations Mozart
[12/09/2019, 00:39:15] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm not even gonna go through it I just trust you

[12/09/2019, 00:42:19] Sandy Cheeks: Aye I hope not!
[12/09/2019, 00:42:28] Spongebob: Normally I'm pretty 50/50 on excitement / sheer terror of going on a date with someone I don't know
[12/09/2019, 00:42:51] Spongebob: The percentage in this instance veers much more in favour of the former than the latter
[12/09/2019, 00:42:57] Spongebob: Can't give precise number ofc

[12/09/2019, 00:43:33] Sandy Cheeks: Like ever
[12/09/2019, 00:43:35] Spongebob: No
[12/09/2019, 00:43:39] Spongebob: Really?
[12/09/2019, 00:43:43] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah
[12/09/2019, 00:43:46] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm a virgin
[12/09/2019, 00:43:55] Spongebob: Well me too but only sexually

[12/09/2019, 00:44:19] Spongebob: *tips fedora*
[12/09/2019, 00:44:20] Sandy Cheeks: Just to clarify
[12/09/2019, 00:44:24] Spongebob: Okay so
[12/09/2019, 00:44:35] Sandy Cheeks: Moving along quickly
[12/09/2019, 00:45:01] Spongebob: I'd say that alcohol helps soothe a lot of the first dates out
[12/09/2019, 00:45:11] Spongebob: I'll be steaming by the time I arrive
[12/09/2019, 00:45:15] Spongebob: (I won't)
[12/09/2019, 00:45:20] Spongebob: ((i might be))
[12/09/2019, 00:45:36] Sandy Cheeks: Or fentanyl
[12/09/2019, 00:45:42] Sandy Cheeks: Hahah what
[12/09/2019, 00:45:59] Spongebob: Hol up
[12/09/2019, 00:46:12] Sandy Cheeks: Not gonna lie I‚Äôll probably have one before I meet you
[12/09/2019, 00:46:22] Spongebob: I've got some meth in the van
[12/09/2019, 00:46:32] Spongebob: (Sung to the tune of old town Road)
[12/09/2019, 00:46:43] Spongebob: Yeah dw I always see off a tinnie or two before a first date
[12/09/2019, 00:47:16] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôll be the horse to your tranquilliser üòçüòç
[12/09/2019, 00:47:32] Spongebob: üòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç
[12/09/2019, 00:47:47] Sandy Cheeks: You‚Äôre gonna have to teach me how to do this whole first date thing
[12/09/2019, 00:47:51] Spongebob: I'll be the crippling addiction to your fledgling career in the arts
[12/09/2019, 00:48:21] Spongebob: Yeah I can do that
[12/09/2019, 00:48:40] Sandy Cheeks: re my last message, is this good pre date chat??
[12/09/2019, 00:48:41] Spongebob: I think casual dinner, accessible alcohol and the chance of putting balls in holes is a good start
[12/09/2019, 00:48:53] Sandy Cheeks: Are we talking dirty rn I can‚Äôt tell???
[12/09/2019, 00:49:04] Spongebob: Well am I aroused?
[12/09/2019, 00:49:22] Spongebob: Sorry *I am aroused
[12/09/2019, 00:49:51] Spongebob: Something about a spoon of ket always gets me in the right mood
[12/09/2019, 00:49:55] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah nice try
[12/09/2019, 00:50:11] Spongebob: Dangit
[12/09/2019, 00:50:43] Sandy Cheeks: That‚Äôll be the dissociation from the crippling reality that is life in a capitalist society
[12/09/2019, 00:50:58] Spongebob: Oh yes, that
[12/09/2019, 00:51:02] Sandy Cheeks: Am I doing this right ??
[12/09/2019, 00:52:04] Spongebob: I was confusing it with the brief relief from the severely depressive lifestyle of being a mid-20s adult living in London
[12/09/2019, 00:52:07] Spongebob: ...baby
[12/09/2019, 00:52:32] Spongebob: Did it work
[12/09/2019, 00:53:29] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm moist tbh

[12/09/2019, 00:53:55] Spongebob: This has taken a turn for the steamier
[12/09/2019, 00:54:45] Sandy Cheeks: Nah look it‚Äôs okay it‚Äôs aight
[12/09/2019, 00:55:00] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôve met some pretty cool people, I‚Äôm yet to meet some üòâ

[12/09/2019, 00:55:32] Sandy Cheeks: Well my house mates
[12/09/2019, 00:55:54] Spongebob: I've read this twice and can't work out what it means
[12/09/2019, 00:56:06] Spongebob: ...yeah...I may have done the same üò∂
[12/09/2019, 00:56:16] Sandy Cheeks: It means I think you‚Äôre cool bro
[12/09/2019, 00:56:33] Spongebob: Oh. Oh yeah okay sick
[12/09/2019, 00:56:50] Spongebob: I've told some pals about you and they're keen to hear how it goes
[12/09/2019, 00:57:01] Sandy Cheeks: Have you told will Dixon??
[12/09/2019, 00:57:05] Spongebob: One message was simply "SHE KNOWS YOLO"
[12/09/2019, 00:57:09] Spongebob: What
[12/09/2019, 00:57:33] Spongebob: What
[12/09/2019, 00:57:38] Sandy Cheeks: What?
[12/09/2019, 00:57:45] Spongebob: How do you know that name
[12/09/2019, 00:58:22] Sandy Cheeks: No mate. You know YOLO, it‚Äôs part of my culture
[12/09/2019, 00:58:33] Sandy Cheeks: That‚Äôs like me meeting you and saying
[12/09/2019, 00:58:38] Sandy Cheeks: HE KNOWS MAPLE SYRUP
[12/09/2019, 00:58:54] Spongebob: Haha, okay point taken
[12/09/2019, 00:59:06] Spongebob: Still what the heck is this
[12/09/2019, 00:59:28] Sandy Cheeks: His user created the France play list
[12/09/2019, 00:59:30] Spongebob: You got this from Spotify didn't you
[12/09/2019, 00:59:32] Spongebob: Thank God
[12/09/2019, 00:59:33] Sandy Cheeks: Also I‚Äôve fucked him
[12/09/2019, 00:59:35] Spongebob: No
[12/09/2019, 00:59:37] Sandy Cheeks: Wait yeah
[12/09/2019, 00:59:38] Sandy Cheeks: Hahahah
[12/09/2019, 00:59:38] Spongebob: So have I
[12/09/2019, 00:59:47] Sandy Cheeks: I bet you have
[12/09/2019, 01:00:03] Sandy Cheeks: What happens in the alps stays in the alps right boys???
[12/09/2019, 01:00:11] Spongebob: Sandy you freaked the bejeezus out of me for a hot second
[12/09/2019, 01:00:36] Sandy Cheeks: Still haven‚Äôt answered my question
[12/09/2019, 01:00:36] Spongebob: üï∫üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏èüëåüí¶üí¶üí¶
[12/09/2019, 01:00:41] Spongebob: What
[12/09/2019, 01:00:47] Sandy Cheeks: Have you told him?
[12/09/2019, 01:01:07] Sandy Cheeks: Because I have and he‚Äôs keen for a three way
[12/09/2019, 01:01:41] Spongebob: Billy (or Bill, your call) is dating an Aussie woman called Julz, so we joked about how Aussies are the superior country
[12/09/2019, 01:01:59] Spongebob: But also due to that information it is unlikely that your story is true
[12/09/2019, 01:02:13] Spongebob: Call me Dwight becayse that is false
[12/09/2019, 01:02:30] Sandy Cheeks: You‚Äôre right
[12/09/2019, 01:02:32] Sandy Cheeks: Four way
[12/09/2019, 01:02:33] Spongebob: Superior people* you know what I meant
[12/09/2019, 01:02:49] Spongebob: Listen I'm down as a clown
[12/09/2019, 01:02:59] Sandy Cheeks: You sound like you need some sleep squarepants!
[12/09/2019, 01:03:19] Spongebob: Yeah I should definitely rest up before work tomorrow...
[12/09/2019, 01:03:26] Spongebob: But yes, bed time for sure
[12/09/2019, 01:03:27] Sandy Cheeks: well fuck
[12/09/2019, 01:03:34] Sandy Cheeks: Here I am thinking we both have to suffer
[12/09/2019, 01:03:39] Sandy Cheeks: But it‚Äôs just me
[12/09/2019, 01:03:39] Spongebob: You've just been done, son
[12/09/2019, 01:03:56] Spongebob: I should probably have prompted earlier but I also didn't want to
[12/09/2019, 01:03:59] Sandy Cheeks: I might just fuck around and come to France
[12/09/2019, 01:04:05] Sandy Cheeks: Neither did I
[12/09/2019, 01:04:13] Sandy Cheeks: Still don‚Äôt
[12/09/2019, 01:04:15] Spongebob: Don't tease me like that
[12/09/2019, 01:04:18] Spongebob: Neither
[12/09/2019, 01:04:40] Spongebob: But also my eurostsr is around 9:30am so I'll save you a seat
[12/09/2019, 01:05:02] Sandy Cheeks: Inb4 on your lap
[12/09/2019, 01:05:05] Sandy Cheeks: Nooooo
[12/09/2019, 01:05:11] Spongebob: Sandy!!
[12/09/2019, 01:05:19] Sandy Cheeks: Sorry!!
[12/09/2019, 01:05:28] Spongebob: That's exactly what I was insinuating!!
[12/09/2019, 01:05:30] Sandy Cheeks: I said I‚Äôm not good at this first date stuff!!
[12/09/2019, 01:06:04] Spongebob: My IRL mild social anxiety + your first date inexperience is going to be FIREWORKS I tell ya
[12/09/2019, 01:06:28] Spongebob: But if you came to France technically it would be our second date next week
[12/09/2019, 01:06:30] Sandy Cheeks: We‚Äôre gonna need a LOT of lubricant
[12/09/2019, 01:06:46] Sandy Cheeks: Social lubricant that is!!! üçªüçª
[12/09/2019, 01:06:47] Spongebob: I've still got loads in the basement don't worry
[12/09/2019, 01:06:52] Spongebob: Haha yes that!
[12/09/2019, 01:06:57] Sandy Cheeks: What?
[12/09/2019, 01:07:01] Spongebob: What?
[12/09/2019, 01:07:04] Sandy Cheeks: What were you talking about
[12/09/2019, 01:07:10] Spongebob: Haha what?
[12/09/2019, 01:07:18] Sandy Cheeks: Haha
[12/09/2019, 01:07:21] Spongebob: Wow is THAT the time?
[12/09/2019, 01:07:28] Sandy Cheeks: Fuck off hahaah
[12/09/2019, 01:07:33] Sandy Cheeks: Nah but I should sleep
[12/09/2019, 01:07:42] Spongebob: Yeah and I should go check the locks
[12/09/2019, 01:07:45] Spongebob: Okay enough of that
[12/09/2019, 01:07:51] Sandy Cheeks: Okay okay
[12/09/2019, 01:07:59] Spongebob: Get some sleep
[12/09/2019, 01:08:05] Sandy Cheeks: Yes sir
[12/09/2019, 01:08:12] Sandy Cheeks: Enjoy your trip!
[12/09/2019, 01:08:16] Spongebob: I'll keep an eye out for some any last minute traveller additions
[12/09/2019, 01:08:23] Spongebob: Thank you! I'll keep you updated
[12/09/2019, 01:08:40] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah do ‚ò∫ really have a great time
[12/09/2019, 01:08:51] Sandy Cheeks: Well speak sooner rather than later xx
[12/09/2019, 01:08:54] Spongebob: Have a good poo-free say at work tomorrow üåù and thanks :)
[12/09/2019, 01:09:16] Spongebob: Sounds good to me xx night night ‚ú®
[12/09/2019, 12:10:55] Spongebob: I just had
[12/09/2019, 12:10:58] Spongebob: The longest
[12/09/2019, 12:11:15] Spongebob: Most whacky conversation with an American woman on this eurostar trip to Paris
[12/09/2019, 12:11:24] Spongebob: Off to meet my pals but will fill you in soon
[12/09/2019, 12:11:34] Spongebob: People are kooky
[12/09/2019, 13:47:51] Sandy Cheeks: Keep her keen I get it i get it
[12/09/2019, 13:48:51] Sandy Cheeks: Americans are always a good time on a long trip, I remember sitting next to this woman when I was flying to Orlando and she sounded like a Fox News anchor
[12/09/2019, 15:33:28] Spongebob: That's right, I am what they refer to as a player
[12/09/2019, 15:33:35] Spongebob: Haha
[12/09/2019, 15:33:50] Spongebob: They always sound like they're doing an impression of a real American
[12/09/2019, 15:35:38] Spongebob: So she's a gun totin' Hillary hatin' lassie from Pittsburgh, who revealed to me with MINUTES to spare that she's close friends with Greg Sestero
[12/09/2019, 15:37:19] Spongebob: But we had a very long and extensive conversation about gun control, politics, Brexit, Trump and religion. It was surprisingly easy to dismantle almost of her arguments until she brought in religion and essentially said "if I die from using my gun, it's fine because I'll just go to heaven"
‚Äé[12/09/2019, 15:38:01] Spongebob: ‚Äé<attached: 00001780-GIF-2019-09-12-15-38-01.mp4>
[12/09/2019, 15:38:16] Spongebob: But very interesting, all in all. Spicy way to start the trip
[12/09/2019, 16:37:17] Sandy Cheeks: That‚Äôs the absolute best way of putting it
[12/09/2019, 16:38:00] Sandy Cheeks: I feel like we may have sat next to the same person, but I doubt the lady I spoke to knew what a brexit was
[12/09/2019, 17:45:43] Spongebob: Ah
[12/09/2019, 17:46:10] Spongebob: The collective ignorance is both a threat and an impressive trait
[12/09/2019, 17:46:59] Spongebob: We have arrived at the house and it is seriously *chefs kiss*

[12/09/2019, 18:40:57] Sandy Cheeks: Sorry for that lame fucking reply
[12/09/2019, 18:41:12] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm catching up with my flat mate who‚Äôs been in IBEEFAH
[12/09/2019, 18:41:40] Sandy Cheeks: Happy?? Can I purchase that somewhere?
[12/09/2019, 18:58:14] Sandy Cheeks: Also I feel cheated, you didn‚Äôt include uno in your list of games
[12/09/2019, 19:04:20] Spongebob: Yeah seriously like what the fuck
[12/09/2019, 19:04:41] Spongebob: Oh yeah?! Did they see Calvin Harris at a sick LED party??
[12/09/2019, 19:04:46] Spongebob: Sorry I don't know their life
[12/09/2019, 19:05:12] Spongebob: I have a couple numbers if you need a fix but they come in small portable packets
[12/09/2019, 19:05:14] Spongebob: Sorry
[12/09/2019, 19:05:18] Spongebob: But it turns out
[12/09/2019, 19:05:33] Spongebob: I'm very good at it
[12/09/2019, 19:24:27] Sandy Cheeks: ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt LED I don‚Äôt think. He was quite good to be fair. I saw him and David guetta in the same night and they were both decent‚Äù
[12/09/2019, 19:24:31] Sandy Cheeks: Direct quote
[12/09/2019, 19:26:31] Sandy Cheeks: I am super curious to know what rules you play by
[12/09/2019, 19:27:27] Sandy Cheeks: Pick up put down? Do you stack +2s and +4s??? Are players permitted to finish on a power card??
‚Äé[12/09/2019, 19:50:07] Spongebob: ‚Äé<attached: 00001810-PHOTO-2019-09-12-19-50-07.jpg>

[12/09/2019, 19:50:22] Spongebob: I'm not angry I'm impressed
[12/09/2019, 19:50:38] Spongebob: David guetta would have been good fun in actuality
[12/09/2019, 19:50:40] Spongebob: So
[12/09/2019, 19:50:50] Spongebob: Pick up put down is what
[12/09/2019, 19:51:42] Spongebob: Cannot stack +anythings because we're not monsters?? And of course they can? Why what are your rules? I'm an Uno virgin for years so I'm very impressionable
[12/09/2019, 19:59:16] Sandy Cheeks: We have a long way to go my sweet syruppy friend
[12/09/2019, 19:59:30] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôll explain it when we play
[12/09/2019, 20:14:29] Sandy Cheeks: As in if you can‚Äôt go, you pick up a card and if you can play it, then you‚Äôre allowed to put it down immediately
[12/09/2019, 20:16:52] Spongebob: Oh BOY
[12/09/2019, 20:17:10] Spongebob: Playing Uno is definitely one of my weirder fetishes

[12/09/2019, 20:18:20] Spongebob: On a separate note ^^
[12/09/2019, 20:18:55] Spongebob: Oh yeah well according to the first online resource I found, this is totally and completely legal and fine
[12/09/2019, 20:19:15] Spongebob: How's your evening going?
[12/09/2019, 20:19:35] Sandy Cheeks: Strip uno can be arranged ??
[12/09/2019, 20:19:39] Spongebob: We've sejourned inside, about 3 bottles in
[12/09/2019, 20:19:44] Spongebob: IZZI

[12/09/2019, 20:26:19] Spongebob: Oh hot
[12/09/2019, 20:26:36] Spongebob: We've identified multiple times we're the same person, so yes
[12/09/2019, 20:26:45] Spongebob: I own the picture version and it's my favourite board game
[12/09/2019, 20:26:54] Spongebob: I would very much like to come if I wasn't here
[12/09/2019, 20:27:09] Spongebob: I'm organising a board & booze game night at mine soon and I can't wait
[12/09/2019, 20:35:04] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôve never played it squarepants don‚Äôt just assume

[12/09/2019, 21:17:07] Spongebob: Oh shit, okay it's fantastic and you'll love it or we're not compatible
[12/09/2019, 21:17:38] Spongebob: Have you ever watched New Girl and /or are aware of the game True American? It's important
[12/09/2019, 21:17:53] Spongebob: First of all proud of u
[12/09/2019, 21:18:06] Sandy Cheeks: We‚Äôre too compatible and Im looking for any reason for us not to get on like a house on fire
[12/09/2019, 21:18:09] Spongebob: Second of all you folks know a good wine so I'm sure it's delicious
[12/09/2019, 21:18:23] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs actually not behd
[12/09/2019, 21:18:25] Sandy Cheeks: That reminds me
[12/09/2019, 21:19:11] Spongebob: It's getting worrying(ly promising) isn't it
[12/09/2019, 21:19:17] Spongebob: Yiss?
[12/09/2019, 21:24:23] Sandy Cheeks: https://youtu.be/-87JIFGEa4s
[12/09/2019, 21:24:40] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs important you watch this

[12/09/2019, 21:26:09] Spongebob: It's a good ssandye to be fair have you seen that chonker
[12/09/2019, 21:29:22] Spongebob: I had a video to show you but I forgot what it was
[12/09/2019, 21:29:27] Spongebob: Make of that information what you will
[12/09/2019, 21:29:41] Sandy Cheeks: that‚Äôs something that Aussies quote all the time
[12/09/2019, 21:30:08] Sandy Cheeks: So I‚Äôm just giving you a bit of insider knowledge in case you get the opportunity to pull an Aussie chick
[12/09/2019, 21:30:39] Spongebob: That's funny I was sort of planning on that happening
[12/09/2019, 21:30:54] Sandy Cheeks: Possibly something to do with the case of wine you‚Äôre plowing through??
[12/09/2019, 21:31:05] Spongebob: I don't see the correlation
[12/09/2019, 21:32:03] Spongebob: I thought I'd mostly shower her with poorly times aunty donna references and hope that she's turned on by it
[12/09/2019, 21:33:17] Spongebob: Speaking of which I don't know how deep your AD knowledge goes but I fuckin love cresps so fuckin much
[12/09/2019, 21:35:58] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs not thattttt deep but I‚Äôll do my research
[12/09/2019, 21:39:11] Spongebob: Awww cresps
[12/09/2019, 21:47:50] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs like puds younger cousin
[12/09/2019, 21:47:57] Sandy Cheeks: Well older cousin because it was first
[12/09/2019, 21:48:14] Sandy Cheeks: How‚Äôs it going down south??
[12/09/2019, 21:48:20] Sandy Cheeks: Geographically I mean ha ha
[12/09/2019, 21:48:47] Spongebob: Most definitely the older cousin
[12/09/2019, 21:49:17] Spongebob: Back in my day aunty donna still had that fourth cousin who apparently has gone off to do law (??)
[12/09/2019, 21:49:45] Spongebob: Sandy you can't just _ask_ that
[12/09/2019, 21:49:54] Spongebob: It's wonderful
[12/09/2019, 21:50:13] Spongebob: Welcome the black parade is being played, wine is being drunk
[12/09/2019, 21:50:27] Spongebob: Life choices are being re-evaluated
[12/09/2019, 21:50:42] Spongebob: How's it going up north for you?
[12/09/2019, 21:50:51] Spongebob: Geographically and / or otherwise
[12/09/2019, 21:55:34] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm so glad to hear that! It sounds lovely
[12/09/2019, 21:59:20] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah I‚Äôm good I‚Äôm pretty tired but it‚Äôs almost the weekend so I‚Äôll get a chance to catch up on some sleep
[12/09/2019, 22:00:52] Sandy Cheeks: Contemplating how much of this Pinot to drink
[12/09/2019, 22:03:42] Spongebob: It's been really nice, definitely need it
[12/09/2019, 22:04:30] Spongebob: As an Aussie the fact that all of it isn't the default is only moderately concerning
[12/09/2019, 22:05:17] Spongebob: Because I'm really cool we've had about 4 or 5 between usb
[12/09/2019, 22:05:38] Spongebob: And because we're even cooler we've become a little bit tired
[12/09/2019, 22:05:49] Sandy Cheeks: Here we goooo keep the typos coming
[12/09/2019, 22:06:27] Sandy Cheeks: Well you‚Äôre at a fork in the road now
[12/09/2019, 22:06:27] Spongebob: Do you mind
[12/09/2019, 22:06:39] Sandy Cheeks: You either drink heaps more or you call it a night
[12/09/2019, 22:06:51] Spongebob: I didn't ask for this
[12/09/2019, 22:07:14] Spongebob: Depends - are you in a full bottle mood?
[12/09/2019, 22:09:23] Sandy Cheeks: Me???
[12/09/2019, 22:09:31] Sandy Cheeks: Why does it matter what mood I‚Äôm in?!
[12/09/2019, 22:11:12] Spongebob: I believe the term is referred to as "peer pressure"
[12/09/2019, 22:11:31] Spongebob: My friends are dangerously close to going to bed but I still have a bit of energy left in me
[12/09/2019, 22:11:43] Sandy Cheeks: Well I‚Äôm gonna go another glass
[12/09/2019, 22:12:04] Sandy Cheeks: We could make this like a long distance first date scenario?
[12/09/2019, 22:15:34] Spongebob: I'm into it
[12/09/2019, 22:16:23] Spongebob: Not that this conversation will be substantially more revealing than the last 5 intensive conversations we've had but me / us being drunk can always reveal some new secrets
[12/09/2019, 22:16:28] Spongebob: I'll grab a fresh bottle
[12/09/2019, 22:16:57] Sandy Cheeks: This is actually pretty cute
[12/09/2019, 22:17:22] Sandy Cheeks: I feel way better about getting drunk by myself in my living room now
[12/09/2019, 22:18:24] Spongebob: This whole experience has been pretty cute but you didn't hear me say it
[12/09/2019, 22:19:02] Spongebob: My pals have just left for bed and I'm anxious about opening a whole new bottle of wine for myself so I will be riding the wave of the last 5 we've finished
[12/09/2019, 22:19:10] Spongebob: What's cracking on your side?
[12/09/2019, 22:19:34] Spongebob: If you want to ask any invasive questions you've been too scared to previously ask now is the time
[12/09/2019, 22:20:45] Sandy Cheeks: How many of you are there?
[12/09/2019, 22:21:03] Sandy Cheeks: And if you say less than 5 then you‚Äôre all pussy bitches
[12/09/2019, 22:21:10] Sandy Cheeks: (Kidding)
[12/09/2019, 22:21:24] Sandy Cheeks: But seriously I need to assess how drunk you are before I ask anything
[12/09/2019, 22:22:10] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm just hanging out downstairs but might take it to the bedroom soon
[12/09/2019, 22:23:06] Spongebob: I don't need to provide this information but if I did it would be and 3 fuck you for judging me
[12/09/2019, 22:23:12] Spongebob: I'm on a good level right now
[12/09/2019, 22:23:50] Sandy Cheeks: Than** holy shit that was close
[12/09/2019, 22:24:16] Spongebob: Wow haha grammar much haha lol
[12/09/2019, 22:24:23] Sandy Cheeks: So vague
[12/09/2019, 22:24:27] Spongebob: This wasn't meant to be a sexual thing right
[12/09/2019, 22:24:34] Sandy Cheeks: All right then keep your secrets
[12/09/2019, 22:24:58] Sandy Cheeks: Why would it be sexual?
[12/09/2019, 22:25:00] Spongebob: Alright I'm drunk enough to tell you about my childhood is That What You Want
[12/09/2019, 22:25:10] Spongebob: No no reason haha
[12/09/2019, 22:25:34] Sandy Cheeks: Depends how fucked up your childhood was
[12/09/2019, 22:25:48] Sandy Cheeks: I could tell you about my childhood dead sober
[12/09/2019, 22:26:50] Spongebob: Psychologically?
[12/09/2019, 22:26:52] Spongebob: Yeah fine
[12/09/2019, 22:28:43] Spongebob: I've made it to bed
[12/09/2019, 22:28:55] Spongebob: ~wine~ water in hand
[12/09/2019, 22:29:17] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm not in bed yet
[12/09/2019, 22:29:33] Sandy Cheeks: I think I‚Äôm gonna shower first though
[12/09/2019, 22:29:35] Spongebob: At 10:30 on a weekday? Unacceptable
[12/09/2019, 22:29:39] Spongebob: Wow okay chillc

[12/09/2019, 22:30:39] Spongebob: Um
[12/09/2019, 22:31:05] Spongebob: Baby by Justin Bieber always gets the boys going
[12/09/2019, 22:31:52] Spongebob: Justin Bieber is a local musician he's probably going to make it big someday
[12/09/2019, 22:32:21] Spongebob: Otherwise I can't think of any off the top of my head
[12/09/2019, 22:32:37] Spongebob: What about Aussie ones? Could use some examples
[12/09/2019, 22:39:55] Sandy Cheeks: Have you ever heard the ‚Äúhere‚Äôs to soandso he‚Äôs true blue‚Äù

[12/09/2019, 22:42:42] Spongebob: I have not
[12/09/2019, 22:43:06] Spongebob: But I can't tell if this is suggesting soandso is a fun person or in need of help
[12/09/2019, 22:43:26] Spongebob: In both examples soandso feels like me
[12/09/2019, 22:44:59] Sandy Cheeks: Soandso can be you
[12/09/2019, 22:45:59] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs just like when it‚Äôs someone‚Äôs birthday and they need to finish the drink they‚Äôre holding
[12/09/2019, 22:46:12] Sandy Cheeks: It will be the first song I sing for you üòçüòçüòç

[12/09/2019, 23:09:50] Spongebob: This works in my favour and I'm not angry about it
[12/09/2019, 23:10:01] Spongebob: We call this "collateral"
[12/09/2019, 23:10:24] Sandy Cheeks: Alright fair is fair

[12/09/2019, 23:13:25] Spongebob: It's...intoxicating
[12/09/2019, 23:13:44] Spongebob: Almost as much as the wine I've forced down me
[12/09/2019, 23:14:33] Sandy Cheeks: So weird I haven‚Äôt received a notification saying you‚Äôve accepted my request
[12/09/2019, 23:14:39] Spongebob: _do I follow back_

[12/09/2019, 23:20:33] Sandy Cheeks: Thanks man I‚Äôm actually fine
[12/09/2019, 23:20:38] Sandy Cheeks: Last year was harder
[12/09/2019, 23:20:54] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs the same day as his birthday too
[12/09/2019, 23:21:09] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs weird cause like you always know on some level you‚Äôre thinking of each other?
[12/09/2019, 23:21:26] Spongebob: I thought you broke up more recently?
[12/09/2019, 23:21:29] Spongebob: Yeah, for sure

[12/09/2019, 23:21:49] Sandy Cheeks: We were together 7 years
[12/09/2019, 23:21:54] Spongebob: Oh gotcha
[12/09/2019, 23:22:09] Spongebob: So a casual thing then
[12/09/2019, 23:22:19] Sandy Cheeks: Broke up early last year, second bf and I were together a year from June last year to this year
[12/09/2019, 23:22:25] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah nothing serious
[12/09/2019, 23:22:26] Spongebob: Sorry I don't know why I'm resorting to humour it's not a light topic
[12/09/2019, 23:22:34] Sandy Cheeks: No strings attached sort of deal
[12/09/2019, 23:22:39] Spongebob: Yeah ofc
[12/09/2019, 23:22:52] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs funny now
[12/09/2019, 23:23:03] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm way past it don‚Äôt worry
[12/09/2019, 23:23:16] Spongebob: Well breakups always suck and there's always some hidden shit going on that you don't expect to feel so I get that it can be a tricky one to navigate
[12/09/2019, 23:23:38] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah exactly! But really truly I‚Äôm very difficult to offend
[12/09/2019, 23:23:57] Spongebob: We call that statement a challenge where I'm from
[12/09/2019, 23:24:20] Sandy Cheeks: Unless you say something like ‚Äúhumans are top of the food chain‚Äù then I‚Äôll cry
[12/09/2019, 23:24:43] Sandy Cheeks: Nice try!! You‚Äôre too polite
[12/09/2019, 23:25:28] Spongebob: No haha I mean kind of haha but like not really I don't know lol!
[12/09/2019, 23:25:40] Spongebob: (Joking srsly)
[12/09/2019, 23:25:47] Spongebob: You don't know that
[12/09/2019, 23:25:53] Spongebob: Sorry for giving you that impression
[12/09/2019, 23:29:27] Sandy Cheeks: You‚Äôre just gonna have to change it
[12/09/2019, 23:30:12] Spongebob: I can work on it
[12/09/2019, 23:30:43] Spongebob: I have what they call in the industry a foot-in-mouth disorder
[12/09/2019, 23:30:59] Sandy Cheeks: That sounds horrible
[12/09/2019, 23:31:11] Sandy Cheeks: What is your job description anyway??
[12/09/2019, 23:31:23] Sandy Cheeks: Like what‚Äôs your day to day role
[12/09/2019, 23:31:56] Spongebob: That's a darn good question
[12/09/2019, 23:32:16] Spongebob: As a drunk person this explanation may be less than accurate
[12/09/2019, 23:32:38] Spongebob: But I help build tools that allow the Guardian to deliver good tech stuff
[12/09/2019, 23:33:00] Spongebob: So, specifically I help with maintaining tools that the journalists use to publish their content
[12/09/2019, 23:33:09] Sandy Cheeks: That‚Äôs so cool!
[12/09/2019, 23:33:24] Sandy Cheeks: My flatmate is a sports journo for the times
[12/09/2019, 23:33:32] Spongebob: It's pretty exciting but also currently quite mind boggling - I've only been there for a few weeks but keen to get stuck in
[12/09/2019, 23:33:34] Sandy Cheeks: He‚Äôs dead jealous you‚Äôre going to Japan
[12/09/2019, 23:33:48] Spongebob: Oh sick üôå Haha, you've told him about my movements?
[12/09/2019, 23:33:57] Sandy Cheeks: That‚Äôs sick, what were you doing before that??
[12/09/2019, 23:34:02] Spongebob: If he wants a guardian hookup holla atcha boi
[12/09/2019, 23:34:22] Sandy Cheeks: He actually might be getting made redundant
[12/09/2019, 23:34:36] Sandy Cheeks: Hahahah
[12/09/2019, 23:34:40] Spongebob: That's loose butthole
[12/09/2019, 23:34:54] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs heavy
[12/09/2019, 23:35:02] Sandy Cheeks: And paired with a post Ibsandya come down
[12/09/2019, 23:35:06] Sandy Cheeks: Poor Marty
[12/09/2019, 23:35:08] Spongebob: Oh dang
[12/09/2019, 23:35:09] Sandy Cheeks: Matty
[12/09/2019, 23:35:30] Spongebob: Maybe he can go back to the future and fix it
[12/09/2019, 23:35:37] Sandy Cheeks: Nah he‚Äôs okay he‚Äôll be safe
[12/09/2019, 23:35:38] Spongebob: That's super long though
[12/09/2019, 23:35:46] Sandy Cheeks: Real low hanging fruit
[12/09/2019, 23:35:57] Spongebob: I actually had to dig for it tbf
[12/09/2019, 23:36:06] Sandy Cheeks: Like rotten bits on the ground tbh
[12/09/2019, 23:36:23] Spongebob: That's my fetish
[12/09/2019, 23:36:33] Sandy Cheeks: So many fetishes
[12/09/2019, 23:36:39] Sandy Cheeks: UNO, rotten fruit
[12/09/2019, 23:36:40] Spongebob: Didn't answer this but not a problem
[12/09/2019, 23:36:53] Sandy Cheeks: Fuck I thought I got away with that one
[12/09/2019, 23:37:00] Sandy Cheeks: YEAH I HAVE OKAY WHATS IT TO YOU
[12/09/2019, 23:37:01] Spongebob: And that's literally scraping the surface
[12/09/2019, 23:37:22] Spongebob: No problem
[12/09/2019, 23:37:50] Sandy Cheeks: He just asked how I‚Äôve been and I said really good and he asked why and then I said well they‚Äôre in France right now
[12/09/2019, 23:38:40] Spongebob: That's sweet
[12/09/2019, 23:38:46] Spongebob: I also notice you didn't assume my gender
[12/09/2019, 23:39:15] Spongebob: Which is at this stage possibly too conservative of you
[12/09/2019, 23:39:42] Sandy Cheeks: Well I go both ways so it‚Äôs not a problem
[12/09/2019, 23:39:43] Spongebob: Unless it's a plural situation at which point wow
[12/09/2019, 23:40:18] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôve explained the situation between will and I
[12/09/2019, 23:40:22] Sandy Cheeks: And you took it as a joke
[12/09/2019, 23:40:22] Spongebob: That works for me
[12/09/2019, 23:40:31] Spongebob: Iz
[12/09/2019, 23:40:40] Sandy Cheeks: Squarepants!
[12/09/2019, 23:40:51] Spongebob: I don't know if the line is visible to you
[12/09/2019, 23:41:06] Spongebob: Or whether you received a mild electric shock when you stepped in it
[12/09/2019, 23:41:16] Spongebob: But to go any further would be a danger to us all
[12/09/2019, 23:41:21] Sandy Cheeks: Which line?
[12/09/2019, 23:41:29] Sandy Cheeks: Only the good kind I hope
[12/09/2019, 23:41:52] Sandy Cheeks: Not the northern line at 8:15 on a Tuesday morning kind
[12/09/2019, 23:42:03] Spongebob: I'm not a sadist
[12/09/2019, 23:42:12] Spongebob: Well I am but not that bad
[12/09/2019, 23:43:25] Spongebob: If you ever end up meeting will you'll also potentially meet his Aussie girlfriend and I'm sure you'll connect on stuff
[12/09/2019, 23:43:51] Spongebob: The specifics of the tuff I cannot specify but I'm sure you'll have things in common
[12/09/2019, 23:44:09] Spongebob: Not in a weird way but I've seen his penis multiple times tonight
[12/09/2019, 23:44:24] Sandy Cheeks: You‚Äôre right that‚Äôs not weird at all
[12/09/2019, 23:44:32] Sandy Cheeks: What stays in the alps huh
[12/09/2019, 23:44:58] Spongebob: The chlamydia begs go disagree
[12/09/2019, 23:45:17] Spongebob: Hey How's that wine treating ya
[12/09/2019, 23:45:29] Spongebob: Or are you choosing to take advantage of this vulnerable drunk man
[12/09/2019, 23:45:36] Sandy Cheeks: Honestly I‚Äôm feeling great
[12/09/2019, 23:45:50] Spongebob: Jesus begs *to
[12/09/2019, 23:46:16] Sandy Cheeks: You‚Äôre not that drunk clearly
[12/09/2019, 23:46:23] Sandy Cheeks: You‚Äôre still funny and clever
[12/09/2019, 23:46:41] Spongebob: That's flattering but I am
[12/09/2019, 23:47:00] Sandy Cheeks: Which one??
[12/09/2019, 23:47:01] Spongebob: I just have an unusual care for grammatical accuracy
[12/09/2019, 23:47:11] Spongebob: I could say the same for you to be fair
[12/09/2019, 23:47:16] Spongebob: I am drunk*
[12/09/2019, 23:47:32] Sandy Cheeks: I was joking
[12/09/2019, 23:47:34] Spongebob: O

[12/09/2019, 23:48:43] Spongebob: I should tell you I deleted insta for a bit, I sometimes take prolonged breaks when I feel it's damaging the ol noggin
[12/09/2019, 23:49:05] Spongebob: But I will check out the website on my phone from time to time when my addiction overcomes me
[12/09/2019, 23:49:10] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôve never deleted it but I probably need to
[12/09/2019, 23:49:13] Spongebob: How long ago?

[12/09/2019, 23:59:37] Sandy Cheeks: What
[12/09/2019, 23:59:39] Spongebob: Can I tailor my answer to the fact that you asking this insinuates that you do?
[12/09/2019, 23:59:42] Spongebob: Haha what?
[12/09/2019, 23:59:48] Sandy Cheeks: Haha
[13/09/2019, 00:00:04] Sandy Cheeks: No I don‚Äôt
[13/09/2019, 00:00:06] Spongebob: I think all smoking is a sin against God
[13/09/2019, 00:00:17] Spongebob: So take what you want from that
[13/09/2019, 00:00:31] Sandy Cheeks: Okay I will
[13/09/2019, 00:01:07] Sandy Cheeks: Nah I just ask cause like I know that it‚Äôs big in Canada and I lived with smokers for a bit
[13/09/2019, 00:01:13] Sandy Cheeks: And I already didn‚Äôt really like it

[13/09/2019, 00:01:58] Spongebob: I actually don't smoke anymore but I am a big fan of weed in the right environments, and think it can do some great stuff
[13/09/2019, 00:02:12] Sandy Cheeks: I agree
[13/09/2019, 00:02:27] Sandy Cheeks: Like less is definitely more personally
[13/09/2019, 00:02:32] Spongebob: I have a more complex answer I can explain irl but I'd smoke more if it didn't decide to give me anxiety a couple years back
[13/09/2019, 00:02:56] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah I totally agree
[13/09/2019, 00:03:05] Sandy Cheeks: It makes me heaps anxious and awkward
[13/09/2019, 00:03:28] Sandy Cheeks: If I have too much
[13/09/2019, 00:03:29] Spongebob: Sorry I momentarily forgot we're the same person
[13/09/2019, 00:03:58] Spongebob: Although for me my tolerance is low these days

[13/09/2019, 00:10:49] Sandy Cheeks: No joke
[13/09/2019, 00:11:15] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôll explain it when I see you, but we hit some major break throughs with the kid I look after
[13/09/2019, 00:11:43] Sandy Cheeks: But when I‚Äôm in a good headspace it makes so much difference

[13/09/2019, 00:30:58] Spongebob: It's many things but standard is not one of them
[13/09/2019, 00:31:34] Sandy Cheeks: Okay well I‚Äôm gonna let you sleep
[13/09/2019, 00:31:44] Spongebob: Yes and likewise
[13/09/2019, 00:32:00] Sandy Cheeks: I could go all night mate
[13/09/2019, 00:32:05] Spongebob: Bruh
[13/09/2019, 00:32:10] Spongebob: Don't tempt me
[13/09/2019, 00:32:19] Sandy Cheeks: You were the one who threw in the towel
[13/09/2019, 00:32:40] Spongebob: That's a fair point
[13/09/2019, 00:32:44] Sandy Cheeks: Wills probably waiting
[13/09/2019, 00:32:47] Sandy Cheeks: I get it
[13/09/2019, 00:33:01] Sandy Cheeks: I wouldn‚Äôt make him wait
[13/09/2019, 00:33:05] Sandy Cheeks: I didn‚Äôt*
[13/09/2019, 00:33:12] Spongebob: I'm still trying to maintain an illusion of class and coolness and can't let you see through the cracks yet
[13/09/2019, 00:33:24] Spongebob: Oh don't worry about him he's satisfied if you know what I mean
[13/09/2019, 00:33:30] Spongebob: And what I mean is sexually
[13/09/2019, 00:33:43] Spongebob: Like through intercourse
[13/09/2019, 00:33:48] Spongebob: Sexual intercourse
[13/09/2019, 00:34:47] Sandy Cheeks: I think that ship sailed when we started comparing the likeness of your kinks and the behaviour of autistic children
[13/09/2019, 00:35:12] Sandy Cheeks: I mean you did mention black humour in your profile so what was I to expect
[13/09/2019, 00:35:32] Spongebob: If anything I'm proud it took that long but also I'm certain I'll regret that joke in the morning
[13/09/2019, 00:35:57] Spongebob: Yeah I guess, I'm glad I haven't scared you away just yet
[13/09/2019, 00:36:20] Sandy Cheeks: It takes a lot to scare me
[13/09/2019, 00:36:28] Sandy Cheeks: You‚Äôre giving it a red hot go though so
[13/09/2019, 00:36:39] Sandy Cheeks: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
[13/09/2019, 00:36:54] Spongebob: Well fuck

[13/09/2019, 00:37:47] Sandy Cheeks: I feel bad
[13/09/2019, 00:37:53] Spongebob: Genuinely sorry if I crossed a line
[13/09/2019, 00:38:02] Sandy Cheeks: There‚Äôs literally no line
[13/09/2019, 00:38:08] Sandy Cheeks: The sooner you realise that
[13/09/2019, 00:38:25] Sandy Cheeks: The sooner we can get to know each other in our entirety
[13/09/2019, 00:38:25] Spongebob: That's good to hear
[13/09/2019, 00:38:42] Sandy Cheeks: Just as long as this is standard chat right? Haha
[13/09/2019, 00:39:01] Sandy Cheeks: Wouldn‚Äôt want to come across to obscure
[13/09/2019, 00:39:12] Spongebob: I am very onboard with that
[13/09/2019, 00:39:27] Spongebob: This is mind-bogglingly easy if I'm being honest
[13/09/2019, 00:39:55] Spongebob: I was not aware it was possible to get long with someone over text this well
[13/09/2019, 00:39:56] Sandy Cheeks: I really hope it‚Äôs the same when we see each other
[13/09/2019, 00:40:05] Spongebob: Yeah me too
[13/09/2019, 00:40:19] Spongebob: Along*
[13/09/2019, 00:40:23] Sandy Cheeks: I can‚Äôt think of why it wouldn‚Äôt be though
[13/09/2019, 00:40:33] Sandy Cheeks: Ohhhhhhhh dear
[13/09/2019, 00:40:54] Spongebob: Oh shit now I realise how that could be read and I wish I was that witty
[13/09/2019, 00:41:17] Spongebob: If it landed well let's pretend I meant to deliver that
[13/09/2019, 00:41:21] Sandy Cheeks: Spongebob Spongebob Spongebob
[13/09/2019, 00:42:06] Spongebob: Neither can I, I'm really looking forward to it

[13/09/2019, 00:42:50] Spongebob: Are you greentexting me right now
[13/09/2019, 00:43:18] Spongebob: > hornypepe.gif
[13/09/2019, 00:43:34] Sandy Cheeks: This is genuinely out of control
[13/09/2019, 00:43:46] Spongebob: Yeah it's fully fucked
[13/09/2019, 00:43:57] Sandy Cheeks: I swear to god I‚Äôm not a freak
[13/09/2019, 00:44:07] Spongebob: Why do you say that?
[13/09/2019, 00:44:10] Sandy Cheeks: Wellllll
[13/09/2019, 00:44:25] Spongebob: Uh oh
[13/09/2019, 00:44:28] Sandy Cheeks: Who the fuck green texts pre first date

[13/09/2019, 00:44:42] Sandy Cheeks: Post first date at that
[13/09/2019, 00:45:02] Sandy Cheeks: Can you tell I have 0 dating experience
[13/09/2019, 00:45:10] Sandy Cheeks: Is it THAT OBVIOUS
[13/09/2019, 00:45:24] Spongebob: Who acknowledges they are aware of the existence of greentext before security in their relationship
[13/09/2019, 00:45:36] Spongebob: Honestly you're doing a bang up job
[13/09/2019, 00:45:55] Spongebob: I can only speak from a personal experience of course
[13/09/2019, 00:46:05] Sandy Cheeks: That sounded really british and you promised me a squeaky Canadian accent
[13/09/2019, 00:46:17] Spongebob: Yeah I thought you'd say that as I sent that
[13/09/2019, 00:46:30] Sandy Cheeks: If I wanted a London accent I would‚Äôve dated my dad
[13/09/2019, 00:46:39] Spongebob: I adopt British sayings over text but never say them out loudb
[13/09/2019, 00:46:48] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah okay buddy

[13/09/2019, 00:47:14] Spongebob: I'm close
[13/09/2019, 00:47:38] Sandy Cheeks: Serious question how much of these conversations do you tell your mates
[13/09/2019, 00:47:48] Spongebob: The details or?
[13/09/2019, 00:47:56] Sandy Cheeks: I mean yeah
[13/09/2019, 00:48:22] Spongebob: I gave an overview to my buddies today and they were distinctly disinterested
[13/09/2019, 00:48:22] Sandy Cheeks: ‚ÄúShe green texted me‚Äù
[13/09/2019, 00:49:06] Spongebob: I feel like they don't appreciate it enough so when I describe it to them they don't understand
[13/09/2019, 00:49:17] Spongebob: But I have tried
[13/09/2019, 00:49:28] Sandy Cheeks: Aye I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll meet them at booze and board games night

[13/09/2019, 00:53:40] Sandy Cheeks: Like a safe word?

[13/09/2019, 00:55:16] Sandy Cheeks: Mighty ducks is pretty mainstream to be fair
[13/09/2019, 00:55:23] Sandy Cheeks: Not my proudest reference
[13/09/2019, 00:55:32] Sandy Cheeks: Speaking of
[13/09/2019, 00:55:33] Spongebob: I guess, but it's more a cherry on an overwhelming cake
[13/09/2019, 00:55:45] Sandy Cheeks: What‚Äôs your star sign
[13/09/2019, 00:55:50] Sandy Cheeks: (Not that I‚Äôm into that)

[13/09/2019, 01:00:17] Spongebob: Nah it's actually not
[13/09/2019, 01:00:51] Spongebob: It's a thing I'd be shitty to tease you for since I have my own beliefs of the same ilk
[13/09/2019, 01:01:14] Sandy Cheeks: No but like you have to understand
[13/09/2019, 01:01:21] Sandy Cheeks: I don‚Äôt subscribe to it at all
[13/09/2019, 01:01:28] Spongebob: I don't personally subscribe to it but there's plenty of things I do buy into
[13/09/2019, 01:01:34] Spongebob: Stop using my words
[13/09/2019, 01:01:45] Sandy Cheeks: I just am very open minded
[13/09/2019, 01:01:52] Sandy Cheeks: I said it first
[13/09/2019, 01:02:10] Spongebob: Fake news
[13/09/2019, 01:02:23] Sandy Cheeks: Oh yeah like what

[13/09/2019, 01:03:08] Sandy Cheeks: Sorry which word was supposed to be side?
[13/09/2019, 01:03:29] Spongebob: I'll have to think of it, nothing overt or obvious. Just like weird beliefs on behaviours based on things
[13/09/2019, 01:03:42] Spongebob: Let that slide* sorry inductions unclear
[13/09/2019, 01:03:58] Sandy Cheeks: You said slide the first time
[13/09/2019, 01:04:04] Spongebob: Yeah but without the the

[13/09/2019, 15:33:17] Spongebob: Feeling a solid 6/10 but with moments of 7 or 8
[13/09/2019, 15:33:20] Spongebob: How's your day going?
[13/09/2019, 16:22:03] Sandy Cheeks: You sure are a 6

[13/09/2019, 16:22:34] Sandy Cheeks: Day was also a 6 if it was out of 100
[13/09/2019, 16:22:39] Sandy Cheeks: Kids were nuts
[13/09/2019, 16:23:34] Sandy Cheeks: One locked himself in a bathroom during assembly, another had a breakdown that went for half an hour, another told the head of the uni that she ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt want to see her face because of her race‚Äù
[13/09/2019, 16:24:07] Sandy Cheeks: Also your hair looks fucking great can I just say
[13/09/2019, 16:57:35] Spongebob: Oh you STOP that right now üò©üòâüòè
[13/09/2019, 16:58:59] Spongebob: That's...a lot. Are these abnormal occurrences or is your "school" actually an institution in disguise
[13/09/2019, 16:59:12] Spongebob: Sorry to hear you've had an intense day though x
[13/09/2019, 16:59:34] Spongebob: Okay so that's both very sweet to say and also funny to mention
[13/09/2019, 17:00:38] Spongebob: I was going to give you a heads up about my recent fuckboi haircut but the fade is okay so it'll be alright
[13/09/2019, 17:00:42] Spongebob: What are you up to this evening?
[13/09/2019, 18:16:36] Sandy Cheeks: The fade is more than okay but that only heightens the level of fuckboi-ery
[13/09/2019, 18:16:54] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm gonna pop my code name cherry
[13/09/2019, 18:17:33] Sandy Cheeks: This is fairly normal
[13/09/2019, 18:17:50] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs a full moon and Friday the 13th so it was to be expected

[13/09/2019, 18:59:31] Spongebob: Don't say that
[13/09/2019, 18:59:44] Spongebob: Did your horoscope anticipate this?
[13/09/2019, 19:00:12] Spongebob: no one knows what it means but it's provocative
[13/09/2019, 19:00:47] Spongebob: I saw this! It's possibly less than pheasable but I might have to give it a college try. What are your thoughts
[13/09/2019, 19:01:22] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs unachievable on my end
[13/09/2019, 19:01:28] Sandy Cheeks: But I‚Äôll give it a red hot go
[13/09/2019, 19:02:18] Spongebob: So red hot

[13/09/2019, 19:04:03] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs sad but true
[13/09/2019, 19:04:16] Spongebob: That's cool but are you doing anything with other people
[13/09/2019, 19:04:26] Sandy Cheeks: Hahahahaha

[13/09/2019, 19:44:08] Spongebob: (We're playing heads up but I'll text you in a second)
[13/09/2019, 19:44:56] Spongebob: ((but also this is entertaining so will be back with you asap))
[13/09/2019, 19:53:05] Sandy Cheeks: I fucking love head
[13/09/2019, 19:53:10] Sandy Cheeks: Heads up*****
[13/09/2019, 19:53:16] Sandy Cheeks: Genuine typo holy shit
[13/09/2019, 19:53:25] Sandy Cheeks: Is it entirely inaccurate though uhhh

[13/09/2019, 19:54:30] Sandy Cheeks: We could duet this?
[13/09/2019, 19:57:13] Sandy Cheeks: And by duet I mean I sing the whole verse
[13/09/2019, 19:57:23] Sandy Cheeks: And you come in with

[13/09/2019, 20:02:20] Spongebob: Sandy
[13/09/2019, 20:02:50] Spongebob: You should be aware of the quantity of wine we're currently drinking and therefore the looseness of my responses
[13/09/2019, 20:03:08] Spongebob: Can you not toy with my emotions?!
[13/09/2019, 20:03:51] Spongebob: Because if you _think_ I won't quietly mouth the lyrics to all parts of the song while you're singing the verse then you're entirely mistaken
[13/09/2019, 20:04:11] Spongebob: Also did I mention I still get a 50% discount at Lush? Since you're having a bath and all
[13/09/2019, 20:04:36] Sandy Cheeks: It was a shower but I‚Äôll take it!
[13/09/2019, 20:05:00] Sandy Cheeks: I will take it
[13/09/2019, 20:06:17] Sandy Cheeks: Honestly I just love putting on an exaggerated Californian accent and unleashing my teenage angst
[13/09/2019, 20:13:33] Spongebob: I have about 9 bath bombs tucked away in my bedside table for the taking
[13/09/2019, 20:13:40] Spongebob: This is my life are you kidding
[13/09/2019, 20:13:49] Spongebob: Playing corridor cricket will be back in a sec xx
[13/09/2019, 20:28:16] Sandy Cheeks: Fuck if you were still playing heads up on this phone I would‚Äôve sent some buses through
[13/09/2019, 20:28:21] Sandy Cheeks: As a laugh x
[13/09/2019, 20:28:49] Sandy Cheeks: Nudes
[13/09/2019, 20:29:13] Sandy Cheeks: I just did a double shot forgive me
[13/09/2019, 20:51:16] Spongebob: Haha wow well okay yeah we're totally still playing heads up as it happens
[13/09/2019, 20:52:33] Spongebob: Not intentionally in an arousing way but I do happen to be in my boxers right now since it's very warm right now
[13/09/2019, 20:52:49] Spongebob: I hope you feel sufficiently "turned on" by this information
[13/09/2019, 20:53:22] Spongebob: I've seen off enough wine to match and will continue to do so
[13/09/2019, 21:04:58] Sandy Cheeks: Pics or it didn‚Äôt happen

[13/09/2019, 21:06:25] Spongebob: That is a plentiful case
[13/09/2019, 21:06:33] Spongebob: But also seems worryingly full
[13/09/2019, 21:06:45] Spongebob: Are those your flatmates?
[13/09/2019, 21:33:12] Sandy Cheeks: Yes sir
[13/09/2019, 21:33:23] Sandy Cheeks: Just won my first round of code names no biggie

[13/09/2019, 22:02:11] Spongebob: Wow
[13/09/2019, 22:03:03] Spongebob: Two nights of debauchery over text seems a bit extreme since we haven't met yet but something something in for a penny
[13/09/2019, 22:03:11] Spongebob: Shit son
[13/09/2019, 22:03:15] Spongebob: Words or pictures?

[13/09/2019, 22:04:04] Spongebob: Whatever that means

[13/09/2019, 22:08:48] Sandy Cheeks: How‚Äôs your game ??
[13/09/2019, 22:12:24] Spongebob: Well she's a big ol loser if that's the case
[13/09/2019, 22:12:50] Spongebob: We've resorted to playing paramore on the couch and it's swekkn

[13/09/2019, 22:15:41] Spongebob: Can we start discussing the ways in which we're not similar because I'm bored of talking to myself
[13/09/2019, 22:16:27] Sandy Cheeks: We would make code names our bitch though can I just say
[13/09/2019, 22:18:56] Spongebob: I mean at this stage I feel like it would be cheating
[13/09/2019, 22:19:05] Spongebob: Are you better at giving or receiving clues?
[13/09/2019, 22:21:41] Sandy Cheeks: All rounder
[13/09/2019, 22:33:44] Spongebob: A specific  and yet very generalist answrr

[14/09/2019, 00:08:05] Spongebob: That top note
[14/09/2019, 00:08:59] Spongebob: To say I don't listen to Hila and Ethan converse on the h3 podcast most weeks is an insult
[14/09/2019, 00:11:32] Spongebob: An indirectly linked q but have you watched Community?
[14/09/2019, 00:13:40] Sandy Cheeks: Nooo I haven‚Äôt
[14/09/2019, 00:13:50] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôve watched Degrassi is that kind of the same?
[14/09/2019, 00:15:10] Spongebob: We found it
[14/09/2019, 00:15:18] Spongebob: The unique difference
[14/09/2019, 00:15:39] Spongebob: Ngl this is a special moment
[14/09/2019, 00:15:56] Spongebob: It is not like degrassi, it's one of the best shows to come out in the last 10 years
[14/09/2019, 00:16:15] Spongebob: Have you watched Rick and Morty
[14/09/2019, 00:16:19] Spongebob: ?*
[14/09/2019, 00:36:37] Sandy Cheeks: Only a hundred times
[14/09/2019, 00:36:45] Sandy Cheeks: I haven‚Äôt watched in ages to be fair
[14/09/2019, 00:36:57] Sandy Cheeks: I thought the latest season was pretty WEAK
[14/09/2019, 00:37:04] Sandy Cheeks: Black mirror?
[14/09/2019, 00:37:13] Sandy Cheeks: Also have you played this game
‚Äé[14/09/2019, 00:37:36] Sandy Cheeks: ‚Äé<attached: 00002628-VIDEO-2019-09-14-00-37-36.mp4>

[14/09/2019, 08:40:58] Spongebob: Narrator: he was
[14/09/2019, 08:45:07] Spongebob: OK very good, so Community is also from Dan Harmon and stars Donald Glover among other people
[14/09/2019, 08:45:19] Spongebob: It's a soft of must-watch and is on Amazon Prime
[14/09/2019, 08:51:32] Spongebob: I liked some of the last season, the ep with the ricklandia or whatever its called is completely fantastic
[14/09/2019, 08:51:46] Spongebob: Black mirror has brilliant episodes, but hasn't been so hot as of late
[14/09/2019, 08:52:43] Spongebob: I have but have literally never seen it done so well
[14/09/2019, 08:56:52] Spongebob: How was last night?
[14/09/2019, 10:01:10] Sandy Cheeks: Morning!!
[14/09/2019, 10:02:42] Sandy Cheeks: Last night was lots of fun, not too late and had some good bonding time with the house mates
[14/09/2019, 10:03:41] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah agreed, some of them legitimately change my life like the one with the two girls set in the 80s
[14/09/2019, 10:20:09] Sandy Cheeks: How are you going? It‚Äôs a ripper day over here (translation the sun is out and the sky is blue)
[14/09/2019, 10:33:48] Spongebob: Wunderbar üôå sounds like time well spent
[14/09/2019, 10:34:24] Spongebob: I still haven't seen that ep! San Junipero I think. I really need to, heard it's one of the best ones
[14/09/2019, 10:34:50] Spongebob: Did you watch the new season?
[14/09/2019, 10:35:25] Spongebob: Something something shrimp something something barbie (sp?)
[14/09/2019, 10:35:53] Spongebob: I just took a brief reddit deep dive, weather's looking hot today so going to relax
‚Äé[14/09/2019, 10:36:44] Spongebob: ‚Äé<attached: 00002646-PHOTO-2019-09-14-10-36-44.jpg>
[14/09/2019, 10:36:51] Spongebob: What are you up to?
[14/09/2019, 10:40:56] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah thats the one it‚Äôs also just so beautiful to watch
[14/09/2019, 10:42:06] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah I did I thought it was well below average although the first one with the fighting game was alrighttt
[14/09/2019, 10:43:00] Sandy Cheeks: Not overlooking this but also not interrogating at this point just yet ü§î
[14/09/2019, 10:43:21] Sandy Cheeks: I just got my oddbox delivery so I‚Äôm trying to figure out what to do with it, any ideas?
‚Äé[14/09/2019, 10:43:37] Sandy Cheeks: ‚Äé<attached: 00002652-PHOTO-2019-09-14-10-43-37.jpg>

[14/09/2019, 10:44:56] Spongebob: I actually loved that episode. Thought it explored something I'd never considered before and was done quite well
[14/09/2019, 10:45:10] Spongebob: Otherwise a meh season though
[14/09/2019, 10:45:42] Spongebob: I'd recommend watching Inside Number 9, similar to black mirror but less about tech more about kooky concepts
[14/09/2019, 10:45:44] Sandy Cheeks: It just validated you and Dixon‚Äôs sexual fantasies didnt it
[14/09/2019, 10:46:14] Spongebob: Put it up your butt
[14/09/2019, 10:46:26] Spongebob: I don't want to talk about it
[14/09/2019, 10:46:44] Spongebob: What Billy and I do on Rocket League is seriously none of your business
[14/09/2019, 10:48:21] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah obvs but I was just asking your advice on which one first?
[14/09/2019, 10:48:36] Spongebob: My (vegan) flatmate also does oddbox, looks like a cool service
[14/09/2019, 10:48:42] Spongebob: Maybe a soup since it's a warm day?
[14/09/2019, 10:49:13] Spongebob: Start wide, in my opinion
[14/09/2019, 10:53:13] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs really good
[14/09/2019, 10:53:24] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah we‚Äôre thinking soup too
[14/09/2019, 10:53:51] Sandy Cheeks: In that case I might just use it like an enema
[14/09/2019, 11:06:11] Spongebob: I was sort being half serious but actually that's definitely the best shout

[14/09/2019, 20:09:04] Spongebob: Can you fucking NOT thank you VERY much
[14/09/2019, 20:09:14] Spongebob: Fortunately for me notifications don't pop up during the game

[14/09/2019, 20:13:38] Spongebob: That's weird because I've been trying to fuck Billy all trip
[14/09/2019, 20:14:21] Spongebob: But ultimately I may or may not agree with you on these statements

[14/09/2019, 20:44:36] Spongebob: That's a big assumption on your end
[14/09/2019, 20:46:02] Sandy Cheeks: I don‚Äôt think so
[14/09/2019, 20:46:29] Spongebob: Do you even know my libido
[14/09/2019, 20:47:09] Sandy Cheeks: Must be pretty high if you‚Äôre a virgin
[14/09/2019, 20:47:40] Spongebob: You have no idea

[14/09/2019, 20:48:24] Spongebob: That's what daddy tells me at least
[14/09/2019, 20:48:55] Sandy Cheeks: Stop me if this is like crazy
[14/09/2019, 20:49:01] Sandy Cheeks: But we could idk maybe
[14/09/2019, 20:49:08] Sandy Cheeks: Test out these um
[14/09/2019, 20:49:08] Spongebob: Praise the Lord?

[14/09/2019, 20:49:21] Sandy Cheeks: OH yes sorry no that‚Äôs what I was gonna say
[14/09/2019, 20:49:24] Spongebob: Don't tease me
[14/09/2019, 20:49:52] Spongebob: We could like experiment?? Just like for science??
[14/09/2019, 20:50:06] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs not teasing if it‚Äôs inevitable
[14/09/2019, 20:50:11] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah exactly!
[14/09/2019, 20:50:22] Sandy Cheeks: Like just to make sure those people aren‚Äôt lying
[14/09/2019, 20:50:35] Spongebob: Yeah no for sure
[14/09/2019, 20:50:37] Spongebob: Like totally
[14/09/2019, 20:50:56] Spongebob: How are we like this and we haven't even met
[14/09/2019, 20:51:13] Sandy Cheeks: I don‚Äôt even know
[14/09/2019, 20:51:19] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs kind of fucked
[14/09/2019, 20:52:20] Sandy Cheeks: I just don‚Äôt want to disappoint in every sense of the word
[14/09/2019, 20:52:25] Spongebob: But also kind of great
[14/09/2019, 20:52:35] Spongebob: That is my single concern about Wednesday
[14/09/2019, 20:53:19] Sandy Cheeks: Like I feel like there‚Äôs a really high bar
[14/09/2019, 20:53:21] Spongebob: But you won't
[14/09/2019, 20:53:32] Sandy Cheeks: I really might
[14/09/2019, 20:53:54] Spongebob: But I also think if you're worried about disappointing you're in very very welcome company
[14/09/2019, 20:54:12] Spongebob: If we're both worried about disappointing each other neither of us will
[14/09/2019, 20:54:16] Sandy Cheeks: Is my ex coming too???
[14/09/2019, 20:54:18] Spongebob: ...probably Haha
[14/09/2019, 20:54:25] Spongebob: Idk but mine is
[14/09/2019, 20:54:49] Sandy Cheeks: No but seriously if I come pretty drunk
[14/09/2019, 20:55:08] Sandy Cheeks: Know it‚Äôs only because I‚Äôm nervous about it not being as great as I think it will be
[14/09/2019, 20:55:16] Sandy Cheeks: No other reason
[14/09/2019, 20:55:35] Spongebob: As if I won't be plastered by the time we meet
[14/09/2019, 20:56:00] Spongebob: Can I just say
[14/09/2019, 20:56:54] Spongebob: If it's not crazy fireworks at first sight it's only because of my social anxiety and not our chemistry
[14/09/2019, 20:57:24] Sandy Cheeks: Oh yeah agreed and mine
[14/09/2019, 20:57:27] Spongebob: That may have been over sharing but whatever
[14/09/2019, 20:58:07] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm not someone who doesn‚Äôt say how they feel
[14/09/2019, 20:58:31] Sandy Cheeks: And I‚Äôm not about the chase at all
[14/09/2019, 20:58:42] Sandy Cheeks: Unless we‚Äôre talking about the show then I‚Äôm all about it
[14/09/2019, 20:59:52] Spongebob: To forget that we're the same person and that I don't also love the chase is a travesty
[14/09/2019, 20:59:59] Spongebob: I can work with this
[14/09/2019, 21:01:34] Sandy Cheeks: And having said that I really like you and I‚Äôm super excited and nervous af for Wednesday
[14/09/2019, 21:02:53] Sandy Cheeks: Nervous that it will go worse than expected and even more nervous if it goes better than expected
[14/09/2019, 21:03:47] Spongebob: I really like you too and am equally nervous / excited about Wednesday
[14/09/2019, 21:04:44] Spongebob: The way I see it, If it's a trainwreck then we've had a great week or two of texting, and if it's not then we have small super short 3 week blip to survive before I'm back in the our country
[14/09/2019, 21:04:57] Spongebob: At which point we can make up for lost time at an aggressive pace
[14/09/2019, 21:05:37] Sandy Cheeks: Exactly like what even is this timing
[14/09/2019, 21:06:05] Sandy Cheeks: Just don‚Äôt wanna lose the momentum if it goes well
[14/09/2019, 21:06:30] Sandy Cheeks: But having said that we haven‚Äôt even met and the longer it‚Äôs been without meeting the better it‚Äôs been getting
[14/09/2019, 21:06:36] Sandy Cheeks: Idk I‚Äôm overthinking it all heaps
[14/09/2019, 21:06:48] Spongebob: But also what is this chemistry
[14/09/2019, 21:07:06] Spongebob: I haven't enjoyed texting someone this much since I was like 15 but whatever
[14/09/2019, 21:07:19] Spongebob: Yeah but if it does we won't, simple as that
[14/09/2019, 21:07:52] Sandy Cheeks: I literally feel like I‚Äôm in high school it‚Äôs so stupid
[14/09/2019, 21:07:55] Spongebob: As a chronic over thinker / worrier I'm just trying to go with the flow
[14/09/2019, 21:08:14] Spongebob: It's weird/great  isn't it
[14/09/2019, 21:08:25] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah it‚Äôs so nice
[14/09/2019, 21:08:43] Sandy Cheeks: Like fucking butterflies are you kidding me
[14/09/2019, 21:08:49] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm a grown woman
[14/09/2019, 21:09:36] Spongebob: It's fucked isn't it
[14/09/2019, 21:09:43] Spongebob: Great, obviously, but fucked
[14/09/2019, 21:09:52] Sandy Cheeks: Ahh okay I‚Äôm glad you feel the same
[14/09/2019, 21:10:07] Spongebob: I was getting worried this was all me tbh
[14/09/2019, 21:10:14] Spongebob: Like this was run of the mill for you
[14/09/2019, 21:12:53] Sandy Cheeks: This is most definitely not that
[14/09/2019, 21:12:57] Sandy Cheeks: This is fucked
[14/09/2019, 21:13:20] Sandy Cheeks: My housemates are like shut up sandy you haven‚Äôt even mET
[14/09/2019, 21:14:55] Spongebob: Thank god
[14/09/2019, 21:15:12] Spongebob: We should come up with a code word when we're the same person
[14/09/2019, 21:15:23] Spongebob: Because this is yet another example of that
[14/09/2019, 21:16:04] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah you did suggest that! okay idk I‚Äôm not good with words
[14/09/2019, 21:16:09] Sandy Cheeks: Well I am
[14/09/2019, 21:16:59] Sandy Cheeks: But you‚Äôre probably better
[14/09/2019, 21:16:59] Spongebob: You are good with words are you kidding
[14/09/2019, 21:17:17] Spongebob: You literally teach how to English
[14/09/2019, 21:18:29] Sandy Cheeks: was that an invitation for some lessons
[14/09/2019, 21:18:47] Spongebob: Only in a freaky sex way
[14/09/2019, 21:18:52] Sandy Cheeks: With grammar like that I‚Äôll teach the fuck out of you
[14/09/2019, 21:19:15] Spongebob: Well I'll fuck the teach out of you
[14/09/2019, 21:19:19] Spongebob: ....sorry
[14/09/2019, 21:20:01] Sandy Cheeks: Never apologise for being funny and clever at the same time
[14/09/2019, 21:20:27] Sandy Cheeks: The semi getting me going part is a bonus
[14/09/2019, 21:20:34] Spongebob: It's literally all i have
[14/09/2019, 21:20:55] Spongebob: Don't say that
[14/09/2019, 21:22:05] Sandy Cheeks: I say what I feel !
[14/09/2019, 21:22:40] Sandy Cheeks: Well
[14/09/2019, 21:22:46] Sandy Cheeks: Not all of what I feel to be fair
[14/09/2019, 21:22:52] Spongebob: Oh yeah?
[14/09/2019, 21:23:29] Spongebob: I try and save the sexting for from date 3 onwards but this is already highly unusual so
[14/09/2019, 21:23:39] Spongebob: Do tell
[14/09/2019, 21:23:55] Sandy Cheeks: Not a chanceeee
[14/09/2019, 21:24:29] Sandy Cheeks: That really would be oversharing
[14/09/2019, 21:24:41] Spongebob: And the consequences for would be...?
[14/09/2019, 21:24:54] Sandy Cheeks: My consequences??

[14/09/2019, 21:26:53] Spongebob: Depends if you're into it?
[14/09/2019, 21:27:14] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm not gonnna lie I‚Äôve been considering it

[14/09/2019, 21:28:22] Spongebob: It would be bold for sure
[14/09/2019, 21:28:30] Sandy Cheeks: Unorthodox even
[14/09/2019, 21:28:45] Spongebob: If I didn't have such high hopes for Wednesday I would have fired them off a LOT earlier
[14/09/2019, 21:29:04] Spongebob: But I don't want to seem disrespectful do have resisted the urge
[14/09/2019, 21:29:09] Sandy Cheeks: If we exchange photos before Wednesday
[14/09/2019, 21:29:14] Spongebob: It is but whatever?
[14/09/2019, 21:29:31] Sandy Cheeks: Then there‚Äôs 0 chance of us meeting somewhere in public

[14/09/2019, 21:31:00] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm kidding but the implication is the same
[14/09/2019, 21:31:53] Sandy Cheeks: I guess it would‚Äôve made more sense to say there‚Äôd be no chance of us ending the night somewhere public
[14/09/2019, 21:32:18] Spongebob: You're not wrong
[14/09/2019, 21:32:25] Spongebob: Here's the thing though

[14/09/2019, 21:32:45] Sandy Cheeks: This is not NORMAL
[14/09/2019, 21:32:45] Spongebob: Rushing it could be risky if we're not going to see each other for 3 weeks

[14/09/2019, 21:34:00] Spongebob: I had this idea in my head that this was just normal for you
[14/09/2019, 21:34:15] Sandy Cheeks: Dead serious?
[14/09/2019, 21:34:28] Spongebob: Because "things" can complicate things
[14/09/2019, 21:34:30] Spongebob: Yeah
[14/09/2019, 21:35:15] Spongebob: Wait sorry no I'm so confident haha

[15/09/2019, 17:25:32] Spongebob: I may have reread some of the chat from last night and it's pretty effin cute
[15/09/2019, 17:28:59] Sandy Cheeks: Don‚Äôt say that

[15/09/2019, 17:35:40] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm not scared of what you said

[15/09/2019, 17:37:30] Spongebob: Kerfuffle on the train
[15/09/2019, 17:38:01] Spongebob: I think we both shared equally, I'm just not used to playing all my cards so obviously when we _literally haven't met yet_
[15/09/2019, 17:38:41] Sandy Cheeks: Neither but like fuck it
[15/09/2019, 17:38:42] Spongebob: I also sent some really sub par nudes which I promise to make up for at a later date
[15/09/2019, 17:38:57] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm gonna hold you to that one
[15/09/2019, 17:39:05] Sandy Cheeks: Also they weren‚Äôt nudes so

[15/09/2019, 17:40:42] Spongebob: Depends, what's your price?
[15/09/2019, 17:41:02] Spongebob: (Also Internet is patchy as hell on this train rn)
[15/09/2019, 17:43:36] Sandy Cheeks: I was thinking a pay what you see fit kind of scenario?
[15/09/2019, 17:44:06] Sandy Cheeks: That way I‚Äôll really put the work in
[15/09/2019, 17:45:44] Spongebob: Yes that works well for me
[15/09/2019, 17:46:15] Spongebob: I have an abundance of shmeckles ready to make their way into your wallet
[15/09/2019, 17:52:25] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm gonna have to rewatch r and m just to understand you

[15/09/2019, 18:00:07] Spongebob: Either way I'd smother that spagett all over me
[15/09/2019, 18:00:14] Spongebob: And NOT in a sexual way stop going there
[15/09/2019, 18:07:45] Sandy Cheeks: No these are all store bought calm down I‚Äôm not that domestic!!!
[15/09/2019, 18:10:16] Sandy Cheeks: Honest question
[15/09/2019, 18:10:50] Sandy Cheeks: How much have you thought about the fact that you turned down our first date last Sunday?
[15/09/2019, 18:15:16] Spongebob: It fuzzied my brain
[15/09/2019, 18:15:19] Spongebob: Hmm
[15/09/2019, 18:15:29] Spongebob: You know
[15/09/2019, 18:15:41] Spongebob: If I'm being honest, I haven't that much
[15/09/2019, 18:16:16] Spongebob: If we met on Sunday I don't know if we would have had the rollercoaster of the week we've had, which would have been bad
[15/09/2019, 18:16:35] Spongebob: Hang on just getting off the train
[15/09/2019, 18:17:39] Sandy Cheeks: Oh I‚Äôm hanging alright
[15/09/2019, 18:17:54] Spongebob: However, we would have known if (/that) we get on irl which would have aided with limiting the anxiety of Wednesday
[15/09/2019, 18:17:57] Spongebob: What do you think?
[15/09/2019, 18:18:00] Spongebob: That's my brain dump

[15/09/2019, 18:42:27] Spongebob: I've sort of left all organising of plans to my parents since it's mostly their holiday so I'm going to be surprised at every corner
[15/09/2019, 18:42:55] Spongebob: I can't really see them? Maybe send them separately so I can gauge?
[15/09/2019, 18:43:06] Spongebob: And they were certainly not mediocre thank you very much
[15/09/2019, 18:44:23] Sandy Cheeks: Check top left it‚Äôs important

[15/09/2019, 18:47:35] Spongebob: I may or  may not have taken a new nude (a newde) this morning to make up for my less than flattering drunken snaps last night
[15/09/2019, 18:54:05] Sandy Cheeks: Well fucks sake why didnt you say something

[15/09/2019, 19:39:02] Spongebob: But
[15/09/2019, 19:40:03] Spongebob: Since we have about 4 millenia to wait after Wednesday we could try to get through a couple dates this week to make up for lost time
[15/09/2019, 19:40:20] Spongebob: Just spitballing here as a hungover boi on a Sunday
[15/09/2019, 19:40:36] Sandy Cheeks: No no I think that makes perfect sense
[15/09/2019, 19:42:10] Sandy Cheeks: Just wear a long sleeved form fitting shirt and that will be enough my friend
[15/09/2019, 19:42:25] Spongebob: Is that your kink?
[15/09/2019, 19:43:45] Sandy Cheeks: One of them yeah
[15/09/2019, 19:44:05] Sandy Cheeks: Okay have you seen dexter??
[15/09/2019, 19:44:16] Spongebob: Weird detour but ok
[15/09/2019, 19:44:23] Spongebob: I haven't
[15/09/2019, 19:44:29] Sandy Cheeks: The shirts he wears when he kills people
[15/09/2019, 19:44:33] Spongebob: Although I know the ending divided people
[15/09/2019, 19:44:34] Spongebob: Christ
[15/09/2019, 19:44:46] Spongebob: Now you're speaking my language
[15/09/2019, 19:44:52] Spongebob: Blood stained or no?
[15/09/2019, 19:45:28] Sandy Cheeks: Haven‚Äôt seen the ending
[15/09/2019, 19:46:03] Sandy Cheeks: But if you wear that shirt I can think of something that will be easily divided
[15/09/2019, 19:49:17] Sandy Cheeks: Nah I‚Äôm kidding wear what you like!
[15/09/2019, 19:49:42] Sandy Cheeks: All looks the same on the floor anyway
[15/09/2019, 19:50:13] Spongebob: Is this awakening something in me?
[15/09/2019, 19:50:31] Spongebob: It's a good hour and 10 minutes away from this being appropriate
[15/09/2019, 19:51:03] Spongebob: Plus me getting an √©rection on the train is going to make the dude sitting next to me really uncomfortable
[15/09/2019, 19:51:07] Spongebob: Unless??
[15/09/2019, 19:51:51] Sandy Cheeks: Unless it‚Äôs billy
[15/09/2019, 19:53:50] Spongebob: It's not but honestly I'll experiment anything with strangers
[15/09/2019, 19:53:51] Spongebob: Haha what?
[15/09/2019, 19:52:09] Sandy Cheeks: Fuck sorry you‚Äôre right whoops
[15/09/2019, 19:52:15] Sandy Cheeks: Better dial it down
[15/09/2019, 19:52:31] Sandy Cheeks: What did you have for breakfast?
[15/09/2019, 19:55:19] Spongebob: An erection why?
[15/09/2019, 19:55:27] Spongebob: Sorry shit it happened again
[15/09/2019, 19:56:03] Spongebob: By the way on the eurostar so getting patchy connection
[15/09/2019, 19:56:40] Sandy Cheeks: We‚Äôre technically strangers ???
[15/09/2019, 19:57:02] Sandy Cheeks: We could do experiments ? For science?
[15/09/2019, 19:57:57] Spongebob: Sandy
[15/09/2019, 19:58:08] Spongebob: Also do you prefer Sandy I need to ask
[15/09/2019, 19:58:23] Sandy Cheeks: I do like sandy
[15/09/2019, 19:58:30] Spongebob: My experiments have been known to be somewhat lengthy affairs
[15/09/2019, 19:58:48] Spongebob: Can be punishing on the test subjects
[15/09/2019, 19:58:58] Spongebob: It's a big ask if you want to be involved
[15/09/2019, 19:59:19] Spongebob: *thinks of clean pure thoughts like a good Jewish boy*
[15/09/2019, 19:59:39] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôll do anything for science
[15/09/2019, 19:59:54] Sandy Cheeks: I mean humanity could be at stake
[15/09/2019, 20:02:44] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm honestly gonna need a shower after this
[15/09/2019, 20:05:12] Sandy Cheeks: By the time I do it could possibly have ticked over to 10:01
[15/09/2019, 20:06:26] Sandy Cheeks: In which case
[15/09/2019, 20:10:06] Spongebob: Thank God these took 10 minutes to arrive
[15/09/2019, 20:10:14] Spongebob: Because this is fucking torture
[15/09/2019, 20:10:26] Spongebob: üòÄ
[15/09/2019, 20:10:40] Spongebob: I'm really enjoying emoji replies recently
[15/09/2019, 20:10:43] Spongebob: But yeah stop
[15/09/2019, 20:10:54] Spongebob: There's only so much I can handle on this train
[15/09/2019, 20:11:15] Sandy Cheeks: Stop like stop? Or stop like keep going
[15/09/2019, 20:11:32] Spongebob: Honestly I don't know
[15/09/2019, 20:11:38] Spongebob: I think they have bathrooms here
[15/09/2019, 20:12:02] Spongebob: And I did pick up my industrial ssandyed French lube
[15/09/2019, 20:15:16] Sandy Cheeks: Okay well let me know what the deal is and I‚Äôll provide the material x
[15/09/2019, 20:15:38] Sandy Cheeks: After 10 of course
[15/09/2019, 20:16:03] Sandy Cheeks: But by then you‚Äôll be home more or less right?
[15/09/2019, 20:17:17] Spongebob: Reeee
[15/09/2019, 20:17:28] Spongebob: This is out of control
[15/09/2019, 20:17:59] Spongebob: You're fucking all of my preconceptions of what to do before a first date
[15/09/2019, 20:18:15] Spongebob: And almost, I hope to be home by 11 or earlier for sure
[15/09/2019, 20:19:21] Spongebob: It was dumb of me to assume I'd get a good night's sleep tonight wasn't it
[15/09/2019, 20:20:38] Sandy Cheeks: So naive squarepants
[15/09/2019, 20:21:32] Spongebob: ^
[15/09/2019, 20:21:59] Sandy Cheeks: So should I let myself in or?
[15/09/2019, 20:22:13] Spongebob: Stop
[15/09/2019, 20:22:24] Spongebob: I can't even use the _unzips_ here
[15/09/2019, 20:22:26] Spongebob: Well
[15/09/2019, 20:22:33] Spongebob: I shouldn't
[15/09/2019, 20:22:35] Spongebob: But?
[15/09/2019, 20:23:25] Spongebob: What are you up to
[15/09/2019, 20:23:56] Sandy Cheeks: Nooo I‚Äôm just joking
[15/09/2019, 20:24:29] Sandy Cheeks: Unless??
[15/09/2019, 20:24:41] Sandy Cheeks: Haha
[15/09/2019, 20:25:56] Spongebob: I'm dying here
[15/09/2019, 20:27:26] Sandy Cheeks: Noo no I should let you sleep
[15/09/2019, 20:28:05] Sandy Cheeks: And definitely not be waiting on your bed
[15/09/2019, 20:29:26] Spongebob: Naked btw?
[15/09/2019, 20:29:40] Spongebob: Don't even dare and answer that my imagination wouldn't be able to take it
[15/09/2019, 20:29:55] Spongebob: Not that it's holding up too well now anyways
[15/09/2019, 20:32:19] Sandy Cheeks: Could you actually imagine hahaha
[15/09/2019, 20:32:22] Sandy Cheeks: What a story
[15/09/2019, 20:33:01] Spongebob: Yes I can and that's seriously causing me issues
[15/09/2019, 20:33:10] Spongebob: But also yeah fucking mental
[15/09/2019, 20:33:18] Spongebob: Not bad but mental
[15/09/2019, 20:33:36] Spongebob: I think I'd have to write it down so I wouldn't forget it
[15/09/2019, 20:33:40] Sandy Cheeks: I mean everyone loves a good story??!
[15/09/2019, 20:35:04] Sandy Cheeks: If I didn‚Äôt have work tomorrow
[15/09/2019, 20:35:47] Sandy Cheeks: I would put you to work tonight 10000%
[15/09/2019, 20:39:11] Spongebob: Fuck
[15/09/2019, 20:39:29] Spongebob: I've bitten my lip so many times in the last hour it might as well be your neck
[15/09/2019, 20:40:04] Spongebob: On an only moderately less sexy tangent I've bought us mini golf for 9:30 on Wednesday
[15/09/2019, 20:40:12] Sandy Cheeks: Just your stock started pre first date kind of chat x
[15/09/2019, 20:40:27] Sandy Cheeks: Perfect! When did you wanna meet?
[15/09/2019, 20:40:37] Spongebob: _zips_
[15/09/2019, 20:40:51] Spongebob: So, maybe 7:30pm at Dinerama?
[15/09/2019, 20:41:00] Spongebob: I haven't checked it's open yet but it should be
[15/09/2019, 20:41:15] Spongebob: Otherwise Boxpark Shoreditch is a hoot and a good fallback plan
[15/09/2019, 20:42:14] Spongebob: Gives enough time to see off a confidence üçª before meeting up
[15/09/2019, 20:42:45] Sandy Cheeks: Yep yep perfect
[15/09/2019, 20:43:04] Sandy Cheeks: Just tell me where to be and I‚Äôll be there
[15/09/2019, 20:44:57] Sandy Cheeks: Or 4
[15/09/2019, 20:45:03] Spongebob: My place, 11pm?
[15/09/2019, 20:45:23] Spongebob: I'll be mainlining vodka by the time I get into the office that day don't worry
[15/09/2019, 20:45:40] Sandy Cheeks: Don‚Äôt tempt me I‚Äôll do it
[15/09/2019, 20:46:29] Sandy Cheeks: You‚Äôll get to meet 4 pint sandy before normal sandy
[15/09/2019, 20:46:46] Spongebob: Deep breathing
[15/09/2019, 20:46:58] Spongebob: I can't wait
[15/09/2019, 20:47:03] Spongebob: (But actually though)
[15/09/2019, 20:52:42] Sandy Cheeks: My body is ready
[15/09/2019, 20:52:53] Sandy Cheeks: To smash you
[15/09/2019, 20:52:56] Sandy Cheeks: At
[15/09/2019, 20:52:59] Sandy Cheeks: Mini golf
[15/09/2019, 20:54:45] Spongebob: I can't wait to punish you
[15/09/2019, 20:55:09] Spongebob: With my iron
[15/09/2019, 20:55:13] Spongebob: At mini golf
[15/09/2019, 20:55:16] Spongebob: But also
[15/09/2019, 20:55:18] Spongebob: Sexually
[15/09/2019, 20:55:26] Spongebob: Am I doing it right
[15/09/2019, 20:56:10] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah no that‚Äôs perfect keep going
[15/09/2019, 20:56:27] Spongebob: Okay um
[15/09/2019, 20:56:36] Spongebob: You're going to find out
[15/09/2019, 20:56:39] Spongebob: Just how good I can be
[15/09/2019, 20:57:02] Spongebob: With nothing but one ball
[15/09/2019, 20:57:06] Spongebob: Are you close
[15/09/2019, 20:57:18] Sandy Cheeks: Fuck
[15/09/2019, 20:58:47] Spongebob: üë¶üèΩüí¶üí¶üí¶üí¶üë©üèº
[15/09/2019, 20:58:52] Sandy Cheeks: Something something driving something something
[15/09/2019, 20:59:04] Spongebob: Me, tanned, having a drink of water to rehydrate in front of you
[15/09/2019, 20:59:11] Spongebob: You had time for this one as well
[15/09/2019, 20:59:34] Spongebob: If you're lucky maybe I'll putter in you
[15/09/2019, 20:59:44] Sandy Cheeks: Jesus Christ
[15/09/2019, 21:00:25] Sandy Cheeks: Wait did we establish if you‚Äôre overly competitive?
[15/09/2019, 21:00:39] Spongebob: Yes? But if not, then yes?
[15/09/2019, 21:00:49] Spongebob: Like, to a challenging degree
[15/09/2019, 21:01:21] Spongebob: Are you?
[15/09/2019, 21:03:17] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm only competitive at things I know I have a chance at
[15/09/2019, 21:03:33] Spongebob: Is this, um, an excuse
[15/09/2019, 21:03:40] Spongebob: Days before we've even started
[15/09/2019, 21:04:15] Sandy Cheeks: Not at all
[15/09/2019, 21:04:21] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm good at mini golf
[15/09/2019, 21:04:42] Sandy Cheeks: And also squarepants
[15/09/2019, 21:05:40] Spongebob: Can't tell if leading into second message or innuendo
[15/09/2019, 21:06:37] Sandy Cheeks: The better we do at golf, the less shots we have to take, the faster we‚Äôll get to the rigorous testing of my theory that you are in fact a tank
[15/09/2019, 21:10:12] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm gonna have to take some measurements
[15/09/2019, 21:11:53] Sandy Cheeks: Leading into second but also works as an innuendo
[15/09/2019, 21:14:37] Spongebob: Yeah both, as it happens
[15/09/2019, 21:15:53] Spongebob: How do you plan on obtaining this information?
[15/09/2019, 21:16:27] Spongebob: I can make myself available for an intense assessment
[15/09/2019, 21:18:52] Sandy Cheeks: Well I happen to know the exact length from my lips to the back of my throat
[15/09/2019, 21:19:05] Sandy Cheeks: But I‚Äôm not really sure how that could be useful
[15/09/2019, 21:19:11] Sandy Cheeks: I just know that information
[15/09/2019, 21:20:05] Sandy Cheeks: Also gonna have to see some proof of force and physical strength
[15/09/2019, 21:21:28] Spongebob: _deeeeeeeeep breathing_
[15/09/2019, 21:21:55] Spongebob: That's no issue
[15/09/2019, 21:22:12] Spongebob: I am experienced with lifting things up
[15/09/2019, 21:22:19] Spongebob: Pulling things very very close to me
[15/09/2019, 21:22:42] Spongebob: And also tearing things off, but I don't see how this could be useful
[15/09/2019, 21:23:56] Sandy Cheeks: No no this is all really good stuff
[15/09/2019, 21:24:09] Sandy Cheeks: There‚Äôs also an endurance test
[15/09/2019, 21:28:44] Sandy Cheeks: And I‚Äôm also going to need to see evidence of restraint and discipline
[15/09/2019, 21:29:17] Spongebob: All i ask is if I don't meet expectations I'm able to take the test again
[15/09/2019, 21:29:19] Spongebob: And again
[15/09/2019, 21:29:21] Spongebob: And again
[15/09/2019, 21:29:24] Spongebob: Until I get it right
[15/09/2019, 21:29:56] Spongebob: As long as the assessment abides by regulation I can do that
[15/09/2019, 21:30:14] Spongebob: I would be fully under your control for the duration of the session
[15/09/2019, 21:31:06] Sandy Cheeks: Yes there will be an allowance for multiple attempts
[15/09/2019, 21:31:55] Sandy Cheeks: For accuracy and validity you know
[15/09/2019, 21:32:18] Sandy Cheeks: The data needs to be consistent and reliable
[15/09/2019, 21:33:01] Spongebob: Of course
[15/09/2019, 21:33:15] Spongebob: Otherwise what a long, sweaty waste of time it'd be
[15/09/2019, 21:33:21] Spongebob: Certainly hard, too
[15/09/2019, 21:33:32] Spongebob: And at times, very rough
[15/09/2019, 21:34:39] Sandy Cheeks: Test ~positions~ conditions will change while the subject remains the same
[15/09/2019, 21:35:17] Spongebob: Of course
[15/09/2019, 21:35:38] Spongebob: Locations and devices among others
[15/09/2019, 21:35:48] Spongebob: (Just ruin my life already)
[15/09/2019, 21:42:42] Sandy Cheeks: Just ruin me
[15/09/2019, 21:42:46] Sandy Cheeks: Haha what?!

[15/09/2019, 21:52:37] Sandy Cheeks: Alright I need to shower soon
[15/09/2019, 21:52:51] Sandy Cheeks: Is it hot where you are ?? Or just here haha
[15/09/2019, 21:58:04] Spongebob: South of my waist I'm in the fucking Sahara

[15/09/2019, 22:03:01] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôll be in the shower most likely so just let yourself in
[15/09/2019, 22:03:21] Spongebob: Just when I got bad thoughts out of my head
[15/09/2019, 22:03:38] Spongebob: She fucking slides one in
[15/09/2019, 22:03:44] Spongebob: Don't even think about it
[15/09/2019, 22:03:49] Spongebob: Well, or do
[15/09/2019, 22:03:49] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm not gonna
[15/09/2019, 22:05:55] Sandy Cheeks: The fact that i could in theory begin my tests tonight
[15/09/2019, 22:06:07] Sandy Cheeks: But I in practicality shouldn‚Äôt
[15/09/2019, 22:06:11] Sandy Cheeks: Is killingggg me
[15/09/2019, 22:09:21] Spongebob: Tell me about it
[15/09/2019, 22:09:30] Spongebob: It would be unwise
[15/09/2019, 22:09:36] Spongebob: But
[15/09/2019, 22:09:41] Spongebob: No it would be bad
[15/09/2019, 22:10:12] Sandy Cheeks: Soooo bad

[15/09/2019, 22:32:43] Spongebob: Do you do this for a living?
[15/09/2019, 22:33:20] Spongebob: Torturing me can be your full time job if not
[15/09/2019, 22:33:38] Spongebob: I may need evidence of these conditions to verify this statement
[15/09/2019, 22:34:01] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm not stopping you from coming
[15/09/2019, 22:34:12] Sandy Cheeks: I intend on doing exactly the opposite

[15/09/2019, 22:35:11] Spongebob: Do you know hard ~I am~ it is for me to be in public right now?
[15/09/2019, 22:35:32] Sandy Cheeks: I could make it harder??
[15/09/2019, 22:35:57] Spongebob: I'd like to see you try at this rate
[15/09/2019, 22:36:34] Sandy Cheeks: As in you don‚Äôt think I have it in me?
[15/09/2019, 22:36:49] Spongebob: As in I don't know if it's physically possible
[15/09/2019, 22:37:07] Spongebob: Unless you see this as a challenge in which case yes that
[15/09/2019, 22:37:48] Sandy Cheeks: If I don‚Äôt have it in me yet I should soon
[15/09/2019, 22:38:30] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm about to muster up the will to get off this couch
[15/09/2019, 22:38:59] Spongebob: Well, occasionally out too
[15/09/2019, 22:39:13] Spongebob: But slowly  back in again
[15/09/2019, 22:39:17] Spongebob: Good luck
[15/09/2019, 22:39:54] Sandy Cheeks: Don‚Äôt even fucking go there

[15/09/2019, 22:41:00] Spongebob: I plan to
[15/09/2019, 22:42:22] Sandy Cheeks: I mean a little bit more wouldn‚Äôt hurt
[15/09/2019, 22:42:52] Sandy Cheeks: Or it might
[15/09/2019, 22:45:24] Sandy Cheeks: With a bit of luck
[15/09/2019, 22:48:35] Spongebob: Depending on your inference I'll leave that open
[15/09/2019, 22:48:55] Spongebob: Just got home
[15/09/2019, 22:49:09] Spongebob: One sec need to say hi to the flatmate before my attention turns completely to you
[15/09/2019, 22:50:35] Sandy Cheeks: So weird I didn‚Äôt here you come in??
[15/09/2019, 22:51:24] Sandy Cheeks: Hear* I‚Äôm not an idiot
[15/09/2019, 22:53:52] Spongebob: Me coming in is more something you'll feel
[15/09/2019, 22:54:20] Spongebob: If you're thinking of showering I'm about to have one
[15/09/2019, 22:54:34] Spongebob: I also will definitely not be thinking of you while I'm having it
[15/09/2019, 22:55:09] Sandy Cheeks: Me neither haha gross
[15/09/2019, 22:55:37] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah I‚Äôm like just about to get in

[15/09/2019, 22:59:54] Sandy Cheeks: Can‚Äôt wait to tell you what is going through my head once it‚Äôs appropriate to be discussing that kind of stuff
[15/09/2019, 23:00:00] Sandy Cheeks: You know post first date
[15/09/2019, 23:00:54] Spongebob: Since the law is pretty clear on this one I'll just have to wait
[15/09/2019, 23:01:02] Spongebob: Because some very interesting things are going through mine too
[15/09/2019, 23:01:09] Sandy Cheeks: Okay okay deal
[15/09/2019, 23:01:14] Spongebob: Also jesus

[15/09/2019, 23:09:02] Sandy Cheeks: Okay I just HAVE to clarify
[15/09/2019, 23:09:11] Sandy Cheeks: This is not normal for me
[15/09/2019, 23:09:23] Sandy Cheeks: Or possibly at all
[15/09/2019, 23:11:42] Sandy Cheeks: I don‚Äôt know about you
[15/09/2019, 23:15:11] Sandy Cheeks: Actually insane, things out of my control are happening
[15/09/2019, 23:17:13] Spongebob: Which part?
[15/09/2019, 23:17:53] Sandy Cheeks: Any of it really
[15/09/2019, 23:17:52] Spongebob: So I was working under the assumption that this was maybe more usual for you than it is for me because this is fucking unusual for me
[15/09/2019, 23:18:05] Spongebob: You should have heard my thoughts last night
[15/09/2019, 23:18:11] Spongebob: Or them now
[15/09/2019, 23:18:25] Spongebob: Maybe I'll whisper them to you sometime
[15/09/2019, 23:18:40] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah you‚Äôll tell me one day I‚Äôm sure
[15/09/2019, 23:18:45] Sandy Cheeks: Or just show me
[15/09/2019, 23:19:26] Spongebob: I can do that
[15/09/2019, 23:19:34] Spongebob: Trying to work out how much to show you tonight
[15/09/2019, 23:19:45] Spongebob: And how once again I will be sleep deprived at work tomorrow

[15/09/2019, 23:21:57] Sandy Cheeks: Wait so you‚Äôre implying this is a below average day ??

[15/09/2019, 23:23:07] Sandy Cheeks: I could say the same
[15/09/2019, 23:23:38] Sandy Cheeks: You‚Äôre fucking me up by sending bits at a time
[15/09/2019, 23:23:46] Sandy Cheeks: I just want the whole thing
[15/09/2019, 23:23:47] Spongebob: In what sense
[15/09/2019, 23:23:55] Spongebob: Trust me this ain't easy for me either
[15/09/2019, 23:24:02] Sandy Cheeks: Idk maybe we could meet sometime idk??

[15/09/2019, 23:25:13] Sandy Cheeks: Ugh keep going
[15/09/2019, 23:25:26] Spongebob: I can't, just typing that finished me off
[15/09/2019, 23:25:49] Sandy Cheeks: Look mom no hands üôå

[15/09/2019, 23:28:50] Sandy Cheeks: Something something climbing on top of you something ahhh idk
[15/09/2019, 23:29:23] Spongebob: Something something pulling your hips close etc etc etc
[15/09/2019, 23:29:33] Spongebob: Scratching your back
[15/09/2019, 23:29:38] Spongebob: And other things I would say
[15/09/2019, 23:29:53] Spongebob: If we weren't in pre first date mode
[15/09/2019, 23:30:23] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah get back to me post first date
[15/09/2019, 23:30:36] Sandy Cheeks: I will write you a novel of what I‚Äôd say
[15/09/2019, 23:32:14] Sandy Cheeks: But I guess for now
[15/09/2019, 23:32:20] Spongebob: A graphic one I hope
[15/09/2019, 23:32:22] Sandy Cheeks: A photo speaks a thousand words??
[15/09/2019, 23:32:45] Spongebob: You're not wrong
‚Äé[15/09/2019, 23:33:13] Spongebob: ‚Äé<attached: 00003832-PHOTO-2019-09-15-23-33-12.jpg>
[15/09/2019, 23:33:59] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs really cute that you think it will be needed
[15/09/2019, 23:34:15] Sandy Cheeks: Can assure you it won‚Äôt
[15/09/2019, 23:34:23] Sandy Cheeks: Real time confirmation
[15/09/2019, 23:34:54] Spongebob: Don't worry tonight I'm mostly just making sure it works
[15/09/2019, 23:35:10] Spongebob: Also fuck that's hot
[15/09/2019, 23:35:23] Sandy Cheeks: This is what I mean
[15/09/2019, 23:35:44] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs like retarded I feel like a teenager
[15/09/2019, 23:36:16] Spongebob: Yeah I know exactly what you mean
[15/09/2019, 23:36:34] Spongebob: As previously stated, it's fucked
[15/09/2019, 23:37:01] Sandy Cheeks: Also just lmk if you need a test subject as well at a later date
[15/09/2019, 23:37:12] Sandy Cheeks: Always happy to help
[15/09/2019, 23:37:27] Spongebob: I do, and I'm letting you know now
[15/09/2019, 23:37:42] Spongebob: I wish i could be using it on you now
[15/09/2019, 23:37:49] Spongebob: Just to get a second opinion of course
[15/09/2019, 23:38:09] Spongebob: It can come in handy in every sense of the word
[15/09/2019, 23:38:14] Spongebob: And currently is
[15/09/2019, 23:38:19] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah of course science is all about repeatability and cross referencing
[15/09/2019, 23:38:27] Sandy Cheeks: Honestly stop
[15/09/2019, 23:38:58] Spongebob: I would but it's hard
[15/09/2019, 23:39:23] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm sure it is
[15/09/2019, 23:39:31] Spongebob: Really fucking hard
[15/09/2019, 23:40:04] Spongebob: You're lucky I need my hands to type
[15/09/2019, 23:40:19] Spongebob: This one was typed with one hand to be fair
[15/09/2019, 23:40:49] Sandy Cheeks: I was gonna say I‚Äôm sure you could manage with one
[15/09/2019, 23:41:24] Sandy Cheeks: If I were there you‚Äôd be hands free of course
‚Äé[15/09/2019, 23:41:26] Spongebob: ‚Äé<attached: 00003858-PHOTO-2019-09-15-23-41-26.jpg>
[15/09/2019, 23:41:37] Spongebob: I'm doing okay yeah
[15/09/2019, 23:41:48] Spongebob: They'd be busy in other places
[15/09/2019, 23:42:27] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah I could only imagine where
[15/09/2019, 23:42:46] Spongebob: I currently am imagining where
[15/09/2019, 23:42:51] Spongebob: And how
[15/09/2019, 23:43:43] Sandy Cheeks: As a drummer I already know you‚Äôre good with your hands
[15/09/2019, 23:44:11] Sandy Cheeks: And pace
[15/09/2019, 23:44:21] Sandy Cheeks: And rhythm
[15/09/2019, 23:44:34] Spongebob: I am
[15/09/2019, 23:44:47] Spongebob: I know when to slow down and speed up
[15/09/2019, 23:44:57] Spongebob: And when to just take my time
[15/09/2019, 23:45:07] Sandy Cheeks: Also if I start sending photos it‚Äôs a slippery fucking slope
[15/09/2019, 23:45:16] Spongebob: Yeah I know
[15/09/2019, 23:45:21] Spongebob: That's why I've been careful
[15/09/2019, 23:45:35] Spongebob: But as mentioned, it's hard
[15/09/2019, 23:45:52] Spongebob: I'd love to show you how hard it's been
[15/09/2019, 23:46:25] Sandy Cheeks: I have some feeling for it
[15/09/2019, 23:47:08] Sandy Cheeks: When I can see you haven‚Äôt seen the message
[15/09/2019, 23:47:11] Sandy Cheeks: Mate
[15/09/2019, 23:47:29] Sandy Cheeks: Mind is in unsavoury places to say the least
[15/09/2019, 23:47:51] Spongebob: This has maybe been the longest tease I've ever experienced
[15/09/2019, 23:47:55] Spongebob: Possibly on both sides
[15/09/2019, 23:48:01] Spongebob: But it's out of control
[15/09/2019, 23:48:19] Sandy Cheeks: And hands what
[15/09/2019, 23:48:52] Spongebob: I wish my hands were instead
[15/09/2019, 23:49:01] Spongebob: Slowly moving down your chest
[15/09/2019, 23:49:10] Spongebob: Nope too much
[15/09/2019, 23:49:30] Sandy Cheeks: We have to keep it tight squarepants
[15/09/2019, 23:49:59] Spongebob: Again, very hard
[15/09/2019, 23:50:10] Spongebob: Shit okay we need to do something about this
[15/09/2019, 23:50:25] Spongebob: Like I'm in dire straits right now
[15/09/2019, 23:50:31] Sandy Cheeks: I was just thinking the same
[15/09/2019, 23:50:51] Spongebob: I might need to take care of myself then jump in a pool of ice
[15/09/2019, 23:50:58] Spongebob: And take a sleeping pill
[15/09/2019, 23:51:05] Sandy Cheeks: Self care is super important
[15/09/2019, 23:51:42] Spongebob: Thinking of something besides me being inside you would be a welcome change for the last ~week~ 3 hours
[15/09/2019, 23:52:02] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm definitely taking my own advice on this one
[15/09/2019, 23:52:35] Spongebob: Shame I can't send you anything more since I shaved while I was in the shower
[15/09/2019, 23:52:49] Spongebob: I can't tell you how much I'd love to see it
[15/09/2019, 23:53:26] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah agreed like it‚Äôs nice to imagine this stuff but even better to actually feel the wall forced against my back
[15/09/2019, 23:53:51] Spongebob: Yeah for fucking sure
[15/09/2019, 23:54:22] Spongebob: Or my hands squeezing your hips
[15/09/2019, 23:56:13] Spongebob: I'd be more graphic but my hands are occupied right now
[15/09/2019, 23:56:14] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah or my legs over your shoulders
[15/09/2019, 23:56:52] Spongebob: Or my lips all over your neck, biting your ears
[15/09/2019, 23:57:57] Sandy Cheeks: If you can manage to type with one hand
[15/09/2019, 23:59:05] Sandy Cheeks: Would I be correct in assuming you are definitely capable of pinning both of my wrists down at the same time single handedly
[15/09/2019, 23:59:31] Spongebob: Where else would they be going
[15/09/2019, 23:59:59] Spongebob: The other one could be anywhere between your hips, your chest, pulling your hair or around your neck
[16/09/2019, 00:00:05] Spongebob: Gotta keep em occupied
[16/09/2019, 00:00:59] Sandy Cheeks: Throat is always a good op
[16/09/2019, 00:01:21] Spongebob: That's good because that's my favourite place
[16/09/2019, 00:01:26] Spongebob: For my hands and other things
[16/09/2019, 00:01:51] Sandy Cheeks: What was that word for when were the same person
[16/09/2019, 00:02:03] Spongebob: I don't think we've made one yet
[16/09/2019, 00:02:36] Sandy Cheeks: Well whatever it is insert now
[16/09/2019, 00:02:54] Spongebob: We should work it out but my  mind is elsewhere rn
[16/09/2019, 00:03:27] Sandy Cheeks: How is this the best feeling and the worst at the same time
[16/09/2019, 00:03:29] Spongebob: It's weird laying on my back here knowing you could be sat on top of me
[16/09/2019, 00:03:37] Spongebob: Get out of my head
[16/09/2019, 00:04:21] Sandy Cheeks: What I would give to know exactly what you were thinking
[16/09/2019, 00:04:51] Spongebob: I think I've reached my peak
[16/09/2019, 00:04:58] Spongebob: This sent me over
[16/09/2019, 00:05:08] Spongebob: I mean not literally try
[16/09/2019, 00:05:09] Spongebob: Yet
[16/09/2019, 00:05:17] Spongebob: But I don't know how to move on from here
[16/09/2019, 00:05:44] Sandy Cheeks: I kind of just want to send you one photo
[16/09/2019, 00:05:54] Spongebob: Just one
[16/09/2019, 00:05:54] Sandy Cheeks: And let you enjoy it
[16/09/2019, 00:05:59] Spongebob: I think
[16/09/2019, 00:06:00] Sandy Cheeks: Justtt one
[16/09/2019, 00:06:04] Spongebob: Given the evening
[16/09/2019, 00:06:07] Spongebob: I can allow it
[16/09/2019, 00:06:10] Spongebob: But just one
[16/09/2019, 00:06:19] Sandy Cheeks: I don‚Äôt know how much you want
[16/09/2019, 00:06:36] Spongebob: Want? Way more than I should probably get
[16/09/2019, 00:06:44] Spongebob: So I'll leave it up to you
[16/09/2019, 00:07:04] Spongebob: What I want is way too dirty for a just one pic
[16/09/2019, 00:07:52] Sandy Cheeks: Okay let me think
[16/09/2019, 00:09:06] Sandy Cheeks: I don‚Äôt want to be straight up
[16/09/2019, 00:09:25] Sandy Cheeks: Because I need to keep you keen to see me somehow
[16/09/2019, 00:09:45] Spongebob: As if that's in any way a problem but yes
[16/09/2019, 00:10:26] Sandy Cheeks: I genuinely don‚Äôt know how I can wait until not only Wednesday for anything
[16/09/2019, 00:10:52] Sandy Cheeks: But Wednesday night after spending a good few hours together
[16/09/2019, 00:11:26] Spongebob: I was thinking that earlier
[16/09/2019, 00:11:35] Spongebob: We may get arrested in mini golf
[16/09/2019, 00:12:00] Sandy Cheeks: I have genuine concerns
[16/09/2019, 00:14:16] Sandy Cheeks: Alright fuck it

[16/09/2019, 18:03:37] Spongebob: which is obviously normal pre first date behaviour but equally like what haha?
[16/09/2019, 18:04:49] Sandy Cheeks: We‚Äôve been doing everything by the book up until now so you‚Äôre right maybe it‚Äôs not a great idea

[16/09/2019, 22:15:22] Sandy Cheeks: Are you guys close?
[16/09/2019, 22:15:45] Spongebob: The tough nature in this area is that I can either disappoint you now or later
[16/09/2019, 22:16:06] Sandy Cheeks: Either way I can‚Äôt wait x
[16/09/2019, 22:16:09] Spongebob: But I'll keep your iMaGiNaTiOn going

[16/09/2019, 22:16:46] Spongebob: Yeah it was good! Weird that I won't see him for another 6 months
[16/09/2019, 22:16:57] Spongebob: Like, I didn't think about it much until it finally happened
[16/09/2019, 22:17:52] Spongebob: My bro and I are now much closer than we were before, yeah. We've both been in London for a while so hung out loads, and had a tradition of seeing all the new Marvel films together
[16/09/2019, 22:18:22] Spongebob: Will be weird for him not to be here for sure, but gives me a reason to head back to Canada and visit which is great üôå
[16/09/2019, 22:18:29] Sandy Cheeks: Are you going home in 6 months then?
[16/09/2019, 22:18:51] Sandy Cheeks: What visa are you on anyway?
[16/09/2019, 22:19:17] Spongebob: Nah I move to Canada in July but will be seeing him in April
[16/09/2019, 22:19:33] Sandy Cheeks: Did I mention I have a british and Australian passport
[16/09/2019, 22:19:42] Sandy Cheeks: Oh shit so how long would you have been here then?
[16/09/2019, 22:20:08] Spongebob: Also I'm not doing that but just wanted to see your reaction üåù I'm sorry I think I'm losing my mind
[16/09/2019, 22:20:34] Sandy Cheeks: What if I told you I was leaving in December ...
[16/09/2019, 22:20:46] Spongebob: I've been here since 11! So I'm a full resident
[16/09/2019, 22:21:00] Spongebob: Will hopefully visit him in April when I get the chance
[16/09/2019, 22:21:09] Spongebob: Listen this has been GREAT

[16/09/2019, 22:21:35] Spongebob: Also I did wonder about this
[16/09/2019, 22:21:53] Spongebob: Yeah but you forgot the golden rule

[16/09/2019, 22:24:24] Sandy Cheeks: Before they are inevitably smashed
[16/09/2019, 22:24:54] Spongebob: I'm mostly following
[16/09/2019, 22:25:33] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs just weird that I‚Äôm thinking about that now and I haven‚Äôt even met you

[16/09/2019, 22:33:44] Spongebob: I'm weirded out by how much this has bummed me out but I'm not sure what to do with this information yet
[16/09/2019, 22:34:15] Sandy Cheeks: Get hinge they said! Have a bit of casual fun they said!
[16/09/2019, 22:34:43] Spongebob: It's fucked
[16/09/2019, 22:35:09] Spongebob: I guess you can always send nudes from Oz?
[16/09/2019, 22:35:22] Spongebob: ~Or from your room tonight ~ haha
[16/09/2019, 22:36:07] Sandy Cheeks: I honestly don‚Äôt know how much to give away
[16/09/2019, 22:36:26] Sandy Cheeks: I feel like last night was a good amount
[16/09/2019, 22:36:36] Sandy Cheeks: But I have to up it each time
[16/09/2019, 22:36:59] Spongebob: I mean
[16/09/2019, 22:37:15] Spongebob: I don't necessarily agree nor do I in anyway disagree
[16/09/2019, 22:37:22] Spongebob: Make what you will of that information
[16/09/2019, 22:39:43] Sandy Cheeks: Way too cryptic for me
[16/09/2019, 22:41:18] Spongebob: Reading it back I can't say I have any idea what to make of it either
‚Äé[16/09/2019, 22:41:37] Spongebob: ‚Äé<attached: 00004244-PHOTO-2019-09-16-22-41-37.jpg>
[16/09/2019, 22:42:02] Sandy Cheeks: Also you need to know I have never sent nudes to anyone other than my two long term boyfriends
[16/09/2019, 22:42:07] Sandy Cheeks: So idk what that means?
[16/09/2019, 22:43:20] Spongebob: I genuinely don't know, I'm still under the impression you're not real and this is all a prank so
[16/09/2019, 22:43:59] Sandy Cheeks: If you can call these nudes smh
[16/09/2019, 22:44:11] Sandy Cheeks: I can do so much better
[16/09/2019, 22:44:42] Spongebob: I'd pull out the *sigh, unzips* if I had anything to unzip
[16/09/2019, 22:44:54] Spongebob: But something something I'd like to see you try something something
[16/09/2019, 22:45:25] Sandy Cheeks: Would you not prefer to have something to look forward to
[16/09/2019, 22:45:32] Sandy Cheeks: Or would you be looking forward to it more
[16/09/2019, 22:46:27] Spongebob: I don't know what I'd prefer but I can say the likelihood of it making me less looking forward to Wednesday is damn near impossible
[16/09/2019, 22:46:33] Spongebob: But that being said
[16/09/2019, 22:46:45] Spongebob: It is fully your call, since I'm being equally withholding
[16/09/2019, 22:47:07] Spongebob: But shit do I want to show you
[16/09/2019, 22:48:12] Sandy Cheeks: So fucked I‚Äôm like counting down the days

[16/09/2019, 22:49:42] Spongebob: ...that is what I meant
[16/09/2019, 22:50:06] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs only fair
[16/09/2019, 22:50:25] Sandy Cheeks: A great idea on your behalf
[16/09/2019, 22:50:41] Spongebob: Thanks I'm kind of good with those
[16/09/2019, 22:51:33] Sandy Cheeks: Not gonna lie I‚Äôm in pretty decent shape at the minute

[16/09/2019, 22:52:15] Spongebob: Not to shower you with ~my juices~ compliments
[16/09/2019, 22:52:17] Sandy Cheeks: So it‚Äôs taking me a lot of self control to not just spam you
[16/09/2019, 22:52:29] Spongebob: I kind of want you to
[16/09/2019, 22:52:34] Sandy Cheeks: And by that you mean maple syrup right?
[16/09/2019, 22:52:50] Spongebob: My willpower to resist myself from asking for it is dwindling
[16/09/2019, 22:52:59] Spongebob: Yes why did you have something else in mind
[16/09/2019, 22:53:12] Sandy Cheeks: Nooo
[16/09/2019, 22:53:18] Sandy Cheeks: Well it‚Äôs the same thing isn‚Äôt it
[16/09/2019, 22:53:50] Sandy Cheeks: I thought that was just canadian biology
[16/09/2019, 22:54:14] Spongebob: It is, interestingly enough
[16/09/2019, 22:59:56] Spongebob: This anticipation may or may not be driving me insane
[16/09/2019, 23:00:02] Spongebob: Thinking about what you're doing right now
[16/09/2019, 23:00:11] Spongebob: And what I'd be doing to you if I was with you
[16/09/2019, 23:01:20] Sandy Cheeks: Fucks sake

[16/09/2019, 23:02:24] Sandy Cheeks: Idk
[16/09/2019, 23:02:28] Spongebob: What do you mean?
[16/09/2019, 23:02:31] Sandy Cheeks: Maybe it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs been a while
[16/09/2019, 23:02:49] Sandy Cheeks: You know what I mean
[16/09/2019, 23:03:25] Spongebob: I think you mean one of two things and my brain is two fried to work out which

[16/09/2019, 23:05:04] Sandy Cheeks: Consider it an act of charity
[16/09/2019, 23:05:08] Sandy Cheeks: You‚Äôre welcome

[17/09/2019, 13:29:52] Spongebob: Nah I actually had that view for a bit, but I realised that the office isn't really the problem, it's more having a role that doesn't give you value that tortures you
[17/09/2019, 13:30:29] Spongebob: Like, offices are pretty fun, there's just a perception that i had as a kid that you just sit in a cubicle banging your head on a desk for 9 hours a day

[17/09/2019, 13:31:28] Sandy Cheeks: And the people you work with make or break it

[19/09/2019, 22:28:43] Spongebob: But once I was on the other side I knew that I had to prioritise myself and I made the right call
[19/09/2019, 22:28:55] Spongebob: Yeah
[19/09/2019, 22:29:11] Sandy Cheeks: Like that is the worst thing I can do is let someone down
[19/09/2019, 22:29:29] Spongebob: They won't feel you've let them down when you tell them you're moving on to study especially
[19/09/2019, 22:29:38] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah I know
[19/09/2019, 22:29:46] Spongebob: Like they care for you and your future, and will be excited to see you move forward
[19/09/2019, 22:29:46] Sandy Cheeks: I know all this that‚Äôs the thing
[19/09/2019, 22:29:52] Spongebob: Yeah yeah I get you
[19/09/2019, 22:30:15] Spongebob: It's that "i know this is silly but" vibe
[19/09/2019, 22:30:20] Spongebob: I live in this space
[19/09/2019, 22:30:39] Sandy Cheeks: I never used to be this bad
[19/09/2019, 22:30:54] Sandy Cheeks: Never had to deal with anxiety until after my first breakup
[19/09/2019, 22:30:59] Spongebob: Let me know what I can do / say that is best btw, I can happily just listen since sometimes that's best x
[19/09/2019, 22:31:05] Sandy Cheeks: And he was a really anxious person and I never understood it
[19/09/2019, 22:31:14] Sandy Cheeks: Thank you I really appreciate it
[19/09/2019, 22:31:21] Sandy Cheeks: Even this is making me feel way better
[19/09/2019, 22:31:41] Sandy Cheeks: And I‚Äôm gonna make a tea
[19/09/2019, 22:31:42] Spongebob: I'm here
[19/09/2019, 22:31:48] Spongebob: Sort ya self
[19/09/2019, 22:32:31] Spongebob: Also deep breathing is super rad
[19/09/2019, 22:32:38] Sandy Cheeks: True
[19/09/2019, 22:33:29] Sandy Cheeks: I have been trying meditation every morning but since starting up so late I‚Äôve been using those 15 mins to sleep
[19/09/2019, 22:33:39] Spongebob: Dude I feel you
[19/09/2019, 22:33:40] Sandy Cheeks: Staying*
[19/09/2019, 22:33:50] Spongebob: I'm desperate to get back into it
[19/09/2019, 22:34:00] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah I was doing so well getting back into it
[19/09/2019, 22:34:04] Spongebob: It pretty much saved me from a lot of stuff in 3rd year
[19/09/2019, 22:34:21] Spongebob: I should tell you now since we're being open and the rule has been met
[19/09/2019, 22:34:57] Sandy Cheeks: Go for it xx
[19/09/2019, 22:34:58] Spongebob: One of the reasons I was panicking about how well this was going is that I'm suffering from some fairly intense mental health issues at the minute
[19/09/2019, 22:35:14] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm really sorry to hear that
[19/09/2019, 22:35:28] Sandy Cheeks: There‚Äôs nothing worse
[19/09/2019, 22:35:30] Spongebob: I'm on the mend I think, but it's been tough over the last 6 months or so
[19/09/2019, 22:35:55] Spongebob: Yeah, it's shit. But I only tell you that as sometimes I'm doing great, other times I'm not so hot
[19/09/2019, 22:36:05] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah of course
[19/09/2019, 22:36:18] Spongebob: Tonight was the latter, I don't like admitting it though
[19/09/2019, 22:36:39] Sandy Cheeks: Was there any particular trigger?
[19/09/2019, 22:36:42] Spongebob: Like even just telling you is uncomfortable for me, but I appreciate it's not
[19/09/2019, 22:37:01] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm actually stoked you feel that you can tell me
[19/09/2019, 22:37:11] Sandy Cheeks: Because it needs to be normalised
[19/09/2019, 22:37:14] Sandy Cheeks: Because it is
[19/09/2019, 22:37:22] Spongebob: Nah, it's just one of those things. I've chalked it down to a chemical inbalance
[19/09/2019, 22:37:44] Spongebob: Yeah agreed, I'm working on being able to say it without feeling weird / weak
[19/09/2019, 22:37:53] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs super hard
[19/09/2019, 22:37:56] Sandy Cheeks: Especially for a guy
[19/09/2019, 22:38:40] Spongebob: Yeah it's been weird
[19/09/2019, 22:38:50] Sandy Cheeks: Was it because of the breakup mostly?
[19/09/2019, 22:38:55] Spongebob: I won't give you my life story yet but I'm excited to sort some shit out I've had for a long time
[19/09/2019, 22:39:04] Spongebob: Nah, if anything it caused the breakup sadly
[19/09/2019, 22:39:28] Spongebob: But it is what it is
[19/09/2019, 22:39:34] Spongebob: I just know I have a lot of work ahead
[19/09/2019, 22:40:15] Sandy Cheeks: Self awareness is the first step hey
[19/09/2019, 22:40:34] Sandy Cheeks: And choosing to do something about it is hard
[19/09/2019, 22:41:15] Sandy Cheeks: But it sounds like you are prepared to put the work in
[19/09/2019, 22:41:31] Spongebob: Yeah I think I am
[19/09/2019, 22:41:41] Spongebob: And that's why you are SO annoying
[19/09/2019, 22:41:36] Sandy Cheeks: Also totally tell me if you wanna go to sleep at any point!
[19/09/2019, 22:42:44] Sandy Cheeks: üòáüòá
[19/09/2019, 22:42:54] Sandy Cheeks: But for real
[19/09/2019, 22:43:15] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm here to listen as a friend at the very least
[19/09/2019, 22:43:28] Spongebob: Just quickly put away my clothes
[19/09/2019, 22:43:34] Spongebob: I think 11 we should call it tonight
[19/09/2019, 22:43:41] Sandy Cheeks: I agree
[19/09/2019, 22:43:42] Spongebob: But i appreciate that üôå
[19/09/2019, 22:44:01] Spongebob: You're really great to talk to and it's SO annoying
[19/09/2019, 22:44:11] Sandy Cheeks: And really no pressure to do tomorrow if you‚Äôre not feeling it
[19/09/2019, 22:44:22] Sandy Cheeks: Even an hour before if you‚Äôre like nope
[19/09/2019, 22:44:25] Sandy Cheeks: I totally get it
[19/09/2019, 22:44:57] Sandy Cheeks: I mean I‚Äôll be FINE
[19/09/2019, 22:45:00] Spongebob: You know normally I'd be like "nah don't be silly we're hanging out" but I'll be honest sometimes I'm like I wish I just said yes thanks
[19/09/2019, 22:45:05] Spongebob: In this scenario
[19/09/2019, 22:45:11] Spongebob: Nah don't be silly we're hanging out
[19/09/2019, 22:45:27] Spongebob: Because at the very least I want someone to be big spoon while we drink and watch TV
[19/09/2019, 22:45:36] Spongebob: And that's you papo
[19/09/2019, 22:45:52] Sandy Cheeks: This sounds bad
[19/09/2019, 22:45:53] Sandy Cheeks: Maybe
[19/09/2019, 22:46:15] Sandy Cheeks: But in a way it could be good we can‚Äôt have sex because there‚Äôs no pressure you know
[19/09/2019, 22:46:29] Spongebob: Wait I thought anal was on the cards
[19/09/2019, 22:46:31] Spongebob: Just kidding
[19/09/2019, 22:46:33] Spongebob: Unless??
[19/09/2019, 22:46:38] Sandy Cheeks: Haha
[19/09/2019, 22:47:35] Sandy Cheeks: Nah I did it once on a family road trip never again
[19/09/2019, 22:47:52] Spongebob: Ooft
[19/09/2019, 22:48:30] Spongebob: I'm too tired to know if this is just a I-fucked-my-dad joke or I- actually-tried-anal statement
[19/09/2019, 22:49:00] Sandy Cheeks: It was my brother but point remains
[19/09/2019, 22:49:23] Spongebob: Well that's relatable
[19/09/2019, 22:49:39] Sandy Cheeks: LOOK
[19/09/2019, 22:49:51] Sandy Cheeks: You‚Äôre gonna go away this weekend and have a fucking sick three weeks
[19/09/2019, 22:50:25] Sandy Cheeks: And tomorrow is gonna be really nice and chill
[19/09/2019, 22:51:00] Spongebob: Yeah I totally am it totally is
[19/09/2019, 22:51:03] Spongebob: And*
[19/09/2019, 22:51:08] Sandy Cheeks: I just hope none of this is to do with me
[19/09/2019, 22:51:12] Sandy Cheeks: And if so I‚Äôm sorry
[19/09/2019, 22:51:37] Spongebob: No it isn't, it's üíØ my own stuff
[19/09/2019, 22:51:58] Spongebob: I think I just didn't want to keep it some secret as it's a sneaky lil fucker
[19/09/2019, 22:52:25] Sandy Cheeks: No it‚Äôs good to know like why hide it?? I‚Äôm an anxious piece of shit too
[19/09/2019, 22:52:35] Spongebob: But equally don't like to be like "Hey I'm Spongebob and I need a therapist" because that only gets my parents into bed what
[19/09/2019, 22:52:57] Spongebob: Yeah anxiety and depression are lit like a fam
[19/09/2019, 22:53:53] Spongebob: But yeah this is legit the first time I've been this honest so I don't blame you for getting sPoOkEd by it
[19/09/2019, 22:54:31] Sandy Cheeks: Nothing can spook me at this point
[19/09/2019, 22:54:56] Sandy Cheeks: I genuinely don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever get as close to someone as fucked up as my ex
[19/09/2019, 22:55:09] Sandy Cheeks: Not saying you‚Äôre fucked up that sounds bAd
[19/09/2019, 22:55:13] Spongebob: Haha
[19/09/2019, 22:55:39] Spongebob: Yeah I mean he did drugs
[19/09/2019, 22:55:43] Spongebob: So like wtf
[19/09/2019, 22:56:01] Sandy Cheeks: He had a lot of demons
[19/09/2019, 22:56:28] Sandy Cheeks: But I‚Äôm not a rehab centre
[19/09/2019, 22:56:32] Sandy Cheeks: And I know that now
‚Äé[19/09/2019, 22:56:33] Spongebob: ‚Äé<attached: 00006013-GIF-2019-09-19-22-56-33.mp4>
[19/09/2019, 22:56:40] Spongebob: This
[19/09/2019, 22:56:43] Spongebob: Was poorly timed
[19/09/2019, 22:56:49] Spongebob: Meant to send that a while ago
[19/09/2019, 22:56:53] Sandy Cheeks: HAHAH
[19/09/2019, 22:57:02] Spongebob: Fucks SAKE
[19/09/2019, 22:57:20] Sandy Cheeks: No I feel like the timing was perfect
[19/09/2019, 22:57:24] Sandy Cheeks: I was getting heavy
[19/09/2019, 22:57:27] Spongebob: Nah
[19/09/2019, 22:57:32] Spongebob: You're not a rehab centre
[19/09/2019, 22:57:45] Spongebob: That must have been really tough for you
[19/09/2019, 22:58:05] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah
[19/09/2019, 22:58:11] Sandy Cheeks: But I thought I deserved it all
[19/09/2019, 22:58:19] Spongebob: Naturally
[19/09/2019, 22:58:26] Sandy Cheeks: Oh of course!
[19/09/2019, 22:58:37] Spongebob: That's the best part as well
[19/09/2019, 22:58:53] Spongebob: It's when you decide that you've done it to yourself
[19/09/2019, 22:59:05] Sandy Cheeks: Ohhh yeah that‚Äôs the kicker
[19/09/2019, 22:59:14] Spongebob: And that you should accept the consequences since its your fault
[19/09/2019, 22:59:31] Sandy Cheeks: Yup!!!
[19/09/2019, 22:59:59] Sandy Cheeks: I mean I don‚Äôt know your specifics of course but the mindset I guess remains the same
[19/09/2019, 23:00:02] Sandy Cheeks: So toxic
[19/09/2019, 23:00:29] Spongebob: Yeah my ex wasn't toxic, I was toxic to myself
[19/09/2019, 23:00:48] Spongebob: I just self destructed since I didn't know how to handle my own thoughts
[19/09/2019, 23:00:55] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah I meant the mindset is toxic
[19/09/2019, 23:01:00] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah me too
[19/09/2019, 23:01:00] Spongebob: Yeah
[19/09/2019, 23:01:05] Spongebob: Yeah it fully is
[19/09/2019, 23:01:11] Sandy Cheeks: Big on the old self sabotage
[19/09/2019, 23:01:24] Sandy Cheeks: Whenever I get bored
[19/09/2019, 23:01:36] Spongebob: What's hilarious is it's all the same shit for everyone and yet we all feel like we're alone in it
[19/09/2019, 23:01:44] Sandy Cheeks: YES
[19/09/2019, 23:01:47] Spongebob: Might just fuck around and wreck my life
[19/09/2019, 23:01:47] Sandy Cheeks: Exactly
[19/09/2019, 23:02:08] Spongebob: Buddy ngl wish you were here right now
[19/09/2019, 23:02:16] Spongebob: I need a hug but like in a cool way
[19/09/2019, 23:02:24] Sandy Cheeks: I genuinely think it‚Äôs been more normalised through like meme culture though
[19/09/2019, 23:02:34] Sandy Cheeks: Aye same
[19/09/2019, 23:02:55] Spongebob: Yeah it's funny, I've been able to express it to my friends purely through dark fucking memes
‚Äé[19/09/2019, 23:03:14] Spongebob: ‚Äé<attached: 00006052-PHOTO-2019-09-19-23-03-14.jpg>
[19/09/2019, 23:03:18] Spongebob: Digging up a few
[19/09/2019, 23:03:21] Sandy Cheeks: Cringe on my part but true
‚Äé[19/09/2019, 23:03:32] Spongebob: ‚Äé<attached: 00006055-PHOTO-2019-09-19-23-03-32.jpg>

[19/09/2019, 23:04:36] Spongebob: Yeah we've got a whole . channel for it in my chat with my pals
[19/09/2019, 23:04:36] Sandy Cheeks: I do think it‚Äôs important that we make light of it in the right way you know
[19/09/2019, 23:04:47] Sandy Cheeks: It makes it more relatable and puts it into perspective
[19/09/2019, 23:05:41] Spongebob: Agreed
[19/09/2019, 23:05:52] Spongebob: You almost lost me to a meme hole there
[19/09/2019, 23:05:49] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah my ex and his mates were the saddest bois
[19/09/2019, 23:06:30] Spongebob: Oh a sadboi?

[19/09/2019, 23:06:52] Sandy Cheeks: I thought he was a badboi at first
[19/09/2019, 23:07:14] Spongebob: When you broke up I hope we wasn't too much of a madboi
[19/09/2019, 23:07:30] Spongebob: Drinking his vegan milk like "this is some badsoi"
[19/09/2019, 23:07:43] Spongebob: I don't know what's wrong with me
[19/09/2019, 23:07:46] Spongebob: Help

[20/09/2019, 08:55:40] Spongebob: There's an oddbox to my right which may have been more appealing to see
[20/09/2019, 08:55:48] Spongebob: Hope you slept well x
[20/09/2019, 10:36:23] Sandy Cheeks: Good hair/chest/arms day etc etc

[20/09/2019, 12:16:14] Spongebob: Call me Christopher because we be walken out in protest
[20/09/2019, 12:16:34] Spongebob: I'd be down for food! I am concerned about having enough time to pack though, so that's my only concern
[20/09/2019, 12:16:44] Spongebob: Also not the best options near me which is unfortunate
[20/09/2019, 12:59:26] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm so fucking mad I can‚Äôt
[20/09/2019, 12:59:51] Sandy Cheeks: But protests aren‚Äôt very autism friendly
[20/09/2019, 13:04:02] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah of course I understand !
[20/09/2019, 13:04:32] Sandy Cheeks: Why don‚Äôt you just let me know what suits you later on
[20/09/2019, 13:13:18] Spongebob: Ah yeah was gonna say, damn shame
[20/09/2019, 13:13:26] Spongebob: Do you know if there are any in the area to go to?
[20/09/2019, 13:13:39] Spongebob: I'm not even autistic and they can be overwhelming
[20/09/2019, 13:13:44] Sandy Cheeks: No I don‚Äôt think so

[22/09/2019, 14:38:04] Spongebob: I relate to that
[22/09/2019, 14:38:19] Spongebob: You should know that you're totally yourself without them
[22/09/2019, 14:38:25] Spongebob: As much as I am with them
[22/09/2019, 14:38:34] Spongebob: When will they be coming back?
[22/09/2019, 14:39:22] Sandy Cheeks: That actually means a lot
[22/09/2019, 14:39:31] Sandy Cheeks: It is probably my biggest insecurity
[22/09/2019, 14:39:41] Sandy Cheeks: And fucking sucks when people are like you look better with them on

[22/09/2019, 14:40:21] Spongebob: There is so much more to you than just one accessory, and I mean that
[22/09/2019, 14:41:17] Spongebob: I don't know if I told you but I do feel super insecure and not confident with my glasses on, so I get how you feel at least to a degree
[22/09/2019, 14:41:40] Spongebob: You're stunning to me without them at least, if that means anything x
[22/09/2019, 14:42:04] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah it‚Äôs exactly the same! Except I feel like not myself unless I‚Äôm wearing something on my face which actually isn‚Äôt me
[22/09/2019, 14:42:08] Sandy Cheeks: Idk it‚Äôs weird
[22/09/2019, 14:42:18] Sandy Cheeks: You‚Äôre a sweetheart

[22/09/2019, 14:43:18] Spongebob: Oh bro if they give you any shit you can just be like you're not my DAD

[22/09/2019, 14:45:09] Sandy Cheeks: I kind of want new ones tbh
[22/09/2019, 14:45:31] Sandy Cheeks: I might get some non prescription ones just for the placebo effect of feeling the glasses on my face
[22/09/2019, 14:45:49] Sandy Cheeks: Because when I‚Äôm wearing my non prescription ray bans I‚Äôm fine
[22/09/2019, 14:46:55] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs just weird cause I didn‚Äôt wear glasses for ages then I needed them again when I started uni

[22/09/2019, 14:48:25] Spongebob: I won't pretend to be like "you don't need them" because I can't decide that
[22/09/2019, 14:48:57] Spongebob: But everyone gets their confidence from different places
[22/09/2019, 14:49:07] Spongebob: And yeah how dare you but also obvs dw

[25/09/2019, 00:29:48] Spongebob: But we can experiment too, I'm sure we won't get it perfect on the first 10 goes so we'll need another 50
[25/09/2019, 00:30:21] Sandy Cheeks: Who am I to deprive you of that
[25/09/2019, 00:30:36] Spongebob: (Also equally I know guy nudes isn't totally your thing but I also 100% take requests)

[25/09/2019, 23:24:35] Sandy Cheeks: But also includes lenses and eye test
[25/09/2019, 23:24:45] Spongebob: Yeah for sure but I think worth it
[25/09/2019, 23:24:48] Spongebob: Exactly
[25/09/2019, 23:25:02] Spongebob: Like glasses are a thing you buy for years and years imo so you want them to last

[25/09/2019, 23:28:42] Spongebob: For glasses years that's like 90
[25/09/2019, 23:29:22] Spongebob: I stupidly had one pair for around that time if not longer, they didn't even break but I hated them on me so never wore them out
[25/09/2019, 23:29:58] Sandy Cheeks: Right!
[25/09/2019, 23:30:09] Sandy Cheeks: And I have had to many occasions where I could have lost them
[25/09/2019, 23:30:11] Sandy Cheeks: Or broken them
[25/09/2019, 23:30:26] Sandy Cheeks: But khamun was the final boss they couldn‚Äôt defeat

[25/09/2019, 23:35:48] Spongebob: I prefer the look of the OQ ones but they're a bit heavier on the ol jew nose so can be painful to wear for a long time
[25/09/2019, 23:36:07] Spongebob: The fact that my nose is Jewish isn't that important but had to slip it in somewhere
[25/09/2019, 23:36:12] Spongebob: Not in a sexual way
[25/09/2019, 23:36:26] Spongebob: Unless??

[27/09/2019, 07:18:44] Sandy Cheeks: Banging from all angle though
[27/09/2019, 07:18:58] Sandy Cheeks: And you‚Äôre getting a bit of colour hey
[27/09/2019, 07:19:04] Sandy Cheeks: Do you normally tan?
[27/09/2019, 07:22:18] Sandy Cheeks: How are you feeling anyway? Don‚Äôt feel like you have to message me
[27/09/2019, 07:22:28] Sandy Cheeks: Seriously no pressure et al
[27/09/2019, 07:25:59] Spongebob: Yeah it's getting there! I do tan quite quickly which is good
[27/09/2019, 07:26:19] Spongebob: Burn like a motha too which is hEaLtHy
[27/09/2019, 07:26:25] Spongebob: Yeah alright now, thanks
[27/09/2019, 07:27:35] Spongebob: I had a fairly large wobble last night, got a bit too drunk and essentially broke down in front of my parents
[27/09/2019, 07:28:11] Spongebob: Mixture of ye ol mental health issues, alcohol and some deeeeeeeeeply entrenched parental issues
[27/09/2019, 07:30:59] Spongebob: Weird though, I feel a bit like I said some stuff I needed to get off my chest. This whole being vulnerable thing is really hard for me but I definitely need to do it more
[27/09/2019, 07:31:32] Spongebob: But equally, I do worry I'm coming across as quite intense to you so let me know if I need to chill a bit x
[27/09/2019, 07:33:35] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah you are
[27/09/2019, 07:33:41] Sandy Cheeks: Don‚Äôt talk to me or my son ever again

[27/09/2019, 07:34:47] Sandy Cheeks: But no of course you‚Äôre not. I‚Äôm actually really glad that you feel like some air has been cleared. I‚Äôve been in the same scenario and it sucks at the time but always ends up being better
[27/09/2019, 07:35:58] Sandy Cheeks: Honestly you can go into as much detail with it as you like or not, I‚Äôm here to listen but also just here if you need someone to send your funny mee mees to
[27/09/2019, 07:36:58] Sandy Cheeks: I feel like you‚Äôre incredibly self aware though which is amazing
[27/09/2019, 07:37:15] Sandy Cheeks: That‚Äôs half the work he
[27/09/2019, 07:37:16] Sandy Cheeks: Hey
[27/09/2019, 07:41:21] Spongebob: You're seriously a ‚≠êÔ∏è

[28/09/2019, 03:05:36] Spongebob: Nah that's not allowed
[28/09/2019, 03:05:51] Sandy Cheeks: Why not
[28/09/2019, 03:06:05] Spongebob: Because you're not going to see that line up so close to me without me coming with

[28/09/2019, 03:07:01] Sandy Cheeks: Plus apparently printworks is sick
[28/09/2019, 03:07:10] Spongebob: I haven't gone to an electronic gig in forever where I liked the lineup
[28/09/2019, 03:07:14] Spongebob: Yeah it's amazing
[28/09/2019, 03:07:20] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm so keen

[28/09/2019, 03:08:29] Spongebob: I'm really impressed you go to nights out alone
[28/09/2019, 03:08:34] Spongebob: It's a really cool thing to do
[28/09/2019, 03:09:25] Spongebob: If I'm genuinely not encroaching on your solo night out I might grab a ticket for that printworks night, but won't pull the trigger immediately
[28/09/2019, 03:10:19] Sandy Cheeks: I honestly prefer it over going anywhere with anyone
[28/09/2019, 03:10:32] Sandy Cheeks: Most of the time
[28/09/2019, 03:11:37] Spongebob: Yeah it sounds sick
[28/09/2019, 03:11:42] Spongebob: Because you just go see music you like

[28/09/2019, 03:23:36] Sandy Cheeks: Nah he was the first guy I‚Äôd slept with since Declan and it was just nice to break that attachment to him you know
[28/09/2019, 03:23:56] Spongebob: Yeah I totally get that
[28/09/2019, 03:24:28] Spongebob: I had that with my ex and it felt really good to move on
[28/09/2019, 03:24:35] Sandy Cheeks: But yeah he was the one who showed me I liked to be handled
[28/09/2019, 03:24:42] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah it‚Äôs the best feeling
[28/09/2019, 03:24:46] Sandy Cheeks: So freeing
[28/09/2019, 03:24:48] Spongebob: For sure
[28/09/2019, 03:24:52] Spongebob: Interesting
[28/09/2019, 03:25:01] Sandy Cheeks: I mean don‚Äôt get me wrong I slept with my ex after we split up
[28/09/2019, 03:25:01] Spongebob: Maybe I do want to see those pics then

[28/09/2019, 03:25:15] Spongebob: Yeah same buddy
[28/09/2019, 03:25:22] Spongebob: Well not my most recent one but before
[28/09/2019, 03:25:26] Sandy Cheeks: But it kind of sucked
[28/09/2019, 03:25:33] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah not my first ex
[28/09/2019, 03:25:36] Sandy Cheeks: I would never
[28/09/2019, 03:25:48] Spongebob: Oh yeah?
[28/09/2019, 03:25:58] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah I faked it and everything
[28/09/2019, 03:26:11] Spongebob: My first relapse after breaking up was actually really hot
[28/09/2019, 03:26:19] Spongebob: Think we both just needed it
[28/09/2019, 03:26:25] Sandy Cheeks: The magic of ‚Äúwe shouldn‚Äôt be doing this‚Äù wore off so quick
[28/09/2019, 03:26:29] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm jealous
[28/09/2019, 03:26:43] Spongebob: That's what alcohol is for
[28/09/2019, 03:26:52] Spongebob: Eh the threesome was the real best post breakup highlight
[28/09/2019, 03:27:03] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah it sounds like it
[28/09/2019, 03:27:04] Spongebob: But also because I didn't feel weird after
[28/09/2019, 03:27:10] Spongebob: We should really get that setup
[28/09/2019, 03:27:19] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah I know
[28/09/2019, 03:28:20] Spongebob: I think my balls are going to fall off that's how blue they are
[28/09/2019, 03:28:42] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs just so far away and I‚Äôm bad at foresight
[28/09/2019, 03:30:53] Sandy Cheeks: I gotta sleep g

[28/09/2019, 10:22:39] Sandy Cheeks: But looking back I wish I‚Äôd gone
[28/09/2019, 10:23:20] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah sarvo is golf then later is dinner with one of my good mates who moved here from Sydney
[28/09/2019, 10:28:13] Spongebob: Ah that's a shame! she's pricey from what I know
[28/09/2019, 10:28:39] Spongebob: To be fair apart from the art in places we're in the middle of God fuck nowhere, it's weird out here in these streets

[28/09/2019, 10:49:26] Spongebob: Oh daaaaaang, no plastic too!
[28/09/2019, 10:49:36] Sandy Cheeks: There was one bit around the spinach
[28/09/2019, 10:49:36] Spongebob: You and flo are seriously making me want to get it
[28/09/2019, 10:49:45] Spongebob: O

[28/09/2019, 10:52:42] Sandy Cheeks: It‚Äôs sooo goood
[28/09/2019, 10:52:56] Sandy Cheeks: A soup with carrots squash and potatoes I think
[28/09/2019, 10:53:06] Sandy Cheeks: Then probably just a salad with the other shit
[28/09/2019, 10:53:12] Sandy Cheeks: We also have a cabbage
[28/09/2019, 10:57:58] Spongebob: Oh you filthy girl
[28/09/2019, 10:58:16] Spongebob: Sounds delish though especially since the weather sounds shittier atm
[28/09/2019, 10:58:37] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah it‚Äôs good great
[28/09/2019, 10:58:46] Sandy Cheeks: I‚Äôm just happy when it‚Äôs not raining at this point
[28/09/2019, 10:59:36] Spongebob: Me too
[28/09/2019, 10:59:54] Spongebob: It hasn't since I've been here and only been 25-30 degree heat but like yeah I hear ya

[28/09/2019, 11:00:20] Sandy Cheeks: Can you handle the heat??
[28/09/2019, 11:00:44] Spongebob: Well I certainly don't get out of the kitchen
[28/09/2019, 11:01:10] Spongebob: But yeah I prefer it to England. Think Canada has got it nailed though, full seasons and proper sun & snow
[28/09/2019, 11:01:35] Spongebob: I'm guessing that sun is a big yes for you?
[28/09/2019, 11:06:39] Sandy Cheeks: Isn‚Äôt it really rainy in Montreal??
[28/09/2019, 11:06:49] Sandy Cheeks: But yeah I agree! Hungary is like that too
[28/09/2019, 11:11:13] Spongebob: Nah man it's good! It's got normal amounts of everything for a Canadian city, besides the snow parts of it
[28/09/2019, 11:11:37] Spongebob: I think I need you to redo your life story as my memory has messed it up already
[28/09/2019, 11:11:47] Spongebob: You're, like, Australian right
[28/09/2019, 11:16:08] Sandy Cheeks: Massive yes. I could lie out on a beach for a week straight with a book and fresh fruit and be the happiest gal
[28/09/2019, 11:16:28] Sandy Cheeks: Yes but also no not at all really
[28/09/2019, 11:16:46] Sandy Cheeks: Born in Budapest to two brits and moved to Sydney when I was like 3
[28/09/2019, 11:16:51] Sandy Cheeks: So Australia is home
[28/09/2019, 11:16:56] Sandy Cheeks: But I‚Äôm not Australian
[28/09/2019, 11:18:16] Spongebob: Yeah same here. I actually want to try that sometime
[28/09/2019, 11:18:59] Spongebob: Canada you have 4 months of that, 4 weird months and 4 months of snowy goodness which works pour moi
[28/09/2019, 11:19:10] Spongebob: right okay this was surprisingly straightforward
[28/09/2019, 11:19:26] Spongebob: So Sziget must have been pretty special since it's your homeland? I absolutely adore Budapest
[28/09/2019, 11:19:54] Spongebob: and I'd say it counts imo, Canadians vibe with that kind of mentality
[28/09/2019, 11:55:40] Sandy Cheeks: Yeah it‚Äôs my favourite
[28/09/2019, 11:55:54] Sandy Cheeks: I love speaking a bit of Hungarian to them and their faces light up
